# Loop Detection & Escalation

## Task Overview

Systematically track solution attempts, detect loop scenarios, and trigger collaborative escalation when agents get stuck repeating unsuccessful approaches. This consolidated framework combines automatic detection with structured collaboration preparation for external AI agents.

## Context

Prevents agents from endlessly repeating failed solutions by implementing automatic escalation triggers and structured collaboration preparation. Ensures efficient use of context windows and systematic knowledge sharing while maintaining detailed audit trails of solution attempts.

## Execution Approach

**LOOP PREVENTION PROTOCOL** - This system addresses systematic "retry the same approach" behavior that wastes time and context.

1. **Track each solution attempt** systematically with outcomes
2. **Detect loop patterns** automatically using defined triggers
3. **Prepare collaboration context** for external agents
4. **Execute escalation** when conditions are met
5. **Document learnings** from collaborative solutions

The goal is efficient problem-solving through systematic collaboration when internal approaches reach limitations.

## Phase 1: Pre-Escalation Tracking

### Problem Definition Setup

Before attempting any solutions, establish clear problem context:

- [ ] **Issue clearly defined:** Specific error message, file location, or failure description documented
- [ ] **Root cause hypothesis:** Current understanding of what's causing the issue
- [ ] **Context captured:** Relevant code snippets, configuration files, or environment details
- [ ] **Success criteria defined:** What exactly needs to happen for issue to be resolved
- [ ] **Environment documented:** Platform, versions, dependencies affecting the issue

### Solution Attempt Tracking

Track each solution attempt using this systematic format:

```bash
echo "=== LOOP DETECTION TRACKING ===" 
echo "Issue Tracking Started: $(date)"
echo "Issue ID: issue-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M)"
echo ""

# Create tracking report
# Create tmp directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p tmp

LOOP_REPORT="tmp/loop-tracking-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M).md"
echo "# Loop Detection Tracking Report" > $LOOP_REPORT
echo "Date: $(date)" >> $LOOP_REPORT
echo "Issue ID: issue-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M)" >> $LOOP_REPORT
echo "" >> $LOOP_REPORT

echo "## Problem Definition" >> $LOOP_REPORT
echo "**Issue Description:** [Specific error or failure]" >> $LOOP_REPORT
echo "**Error Location:** [File, line, or component]" >> $LOOP_REPORT
echo "**Root Cause Hypothesis:** [Current understanding]" >> $LOOP_REPORT
echo "**Success Criteria:** [What needs to work]" >> $LOOP_REPORT
echo "**Environment:** [Platform, versions, dependencies]" >> $LOOP_REPORT
echo "" >> $LOOP_REPORT

echo "## Solution Attempt Log" >> $LOOP_REPORT
ATTEMPT_COUNT=0
```

**For each solution attempt, document:**

```markdown
### Attempt #[N]: [Brief description]
- **Start Time:** [timestamp]
- **Approach:** [Description of solution attempted]
- **Hypothesis:** [Why this approach should work]
- **Actions Taken:** [Specific steps executed]
- **Code Changes:** [Files modified and how]
- **Test Results:** [What happened when tested]
- **Result:** [Success/Failure/Partial success]
- **Learning:** [What this attempt revealed about the problem]
- **New Information:** [Any new understanding gained]
- **Next Hypothesis:** [How this changes understanding of the issue]
- **End Time:** [timestamp]
- **Duration:** [time spent on this attempt]
```

### Automated Attempt Logging

```bash
# Function to log solution attempts
log_attempt() {
    local attempt_num=$1
    local approach="$2"
    local result="$3"
    local learning="$4"
    
    ATTEMPT_COUNT=$((ATTEMPT_COUNT + 1))
    
    echo "" >> $LOOP_REPORT
    echo "### Attempt #$ATTEMPT_COUNT: $approach" >> $LOOP_REPORT
    echo "- **Start Time:** $(date)" >> $LOOP_REPORT
    echo "- **Approach:** $approach" >> $LOOP_REPORT
    echo "- **Result:** $result" >> $LOOP_REPORT
    echo "- **Learning:** $learning" >> $LOOP_REPORT
    echo "- **Duration:** [manual entry required]" >> $LOOP_REPORT
    
    # Check for escalation triggers after each attempt
    check_escalation_triggers
}

# Function to check escalation triggers
check_escalation_triggers() {
    local should_escalate=false
    
    echo "## Escalation Check #$ATTEMPT_COUNT" >> $LOOP_REPORT
    echo "Time: $(date)" >> $LOOP_REPORT
    
    # Check attempt count trigger
    if [ $ATTEMPT_COUNT -ge 3 ]; then
        echo "ðŸš¨ **TRIGGER**: 3+ failed attempts detected ($ATTEMPT_COUNT attempts)" >> $LOOP_REPORT
        should_escalate=true
    fi
    
    # Check for repetitive patterns (manual analysis required)
    echo "- **Repetitive Approaches:** [Manual assessment needed]" >> $LOOP_REPORT
    echo "- **Circular Reasoning:** [Manual assessment needed]" >> $LOOP_REPORT
    echo "- **Diminishing Returns:** [Manual assessment needed]" >> $LOOP_REPORT
    
    # Time-based trigger (manual tracking required)
    echo "- **Time Threshold:** [Manual time tracking needed - trigger at 90+ minutes]" >> $LOOP_REPORT
    echo "- **Context Window Pressure:** [Manual assessment of context usage]" >> $LOOP_REPORT
    
    if [ "$should_escalate" == "true" ]; then
        echo "" >> $LOOP_REPORT
        echo "âš¡ **ESCALATION TRIGGERED** - Preparing collaboration request..." >> $LOOP_REPORT
        prepare_collaboration_request
    fi
}
```

## Phase 2: Loop Detection Indicators

### Automatic Detection Triggers

The system monitors for these escalation conditions:

```bash
# Loop Detection Configuration
FAILED_ATTEMPTS=3           # 3+ failed solution attempts
TIME_LIMIT_MINUTES=90       # 90+ minutes on single issue  
PATTERN_REPETITION=true     # Repeating previously tried solutions
CONTEXT_PRESSURE=high       # Approaching context window limits
DIMINISHING_RETURNS=true    # Each attempt provides less information
```

### Manual Detection Checklist

Monitor these indicators during problem-solving:

- [ ] **Repetitive approaches:** Same or very similar solutions attempted multiple times
- [ ] **Circular reasoning:** Solution attempts that return to previously tried approaches  
- [ ] **Diminishing returns:** Each attempt provides less new information than the previous
- [ ] **Time threshold exceeded:** More than 90 minutes spent on single issue without progress
- [ ] **Context window pressure:** Approaching context limits due to extensive debugging
- [ ] **Decreasing confidence:** Solutions becoming more speculative rather than systematic
- [ ] **Resource exhaustion:** Running out of approaches within current knowledge domain

### Escalation Trigger Assessment

```bash
# Function to assess escalation need
assess_escalation_need() {
    echo "=== ESCALATION ASSESSMENT ===" >> $LOOP_REPORT
    echo "Assessment Time: $(date)" >> $LOOP_REPORT
    echo "" >> $LOOP_REPORT
    
    echo "### Automatic Triggers:" >> $LOOP_REPORT
    echo "- **Failed Attempts:** $ATTEMPT_COUNT (trigger: â‰¥3)" >> $LOOP_REPORT
    echo "- **Time Investment:** [Manual tracking] (trigger: â‰¥90 minutes)" >> $LOOP_REPORT
    echo "- **Pattern Repetition:** [Manual assessment] (trigger: repeating approaches)" >> $LOOP_REPORT
    echo "- **Context Pressure:** [Manual assessment] (trigger: approaching limits)" >> $LOOP_REPORT
    echo "" >> $LOOP_REPORT
    
    echo "### Manual Assessment Required:" >> $LOOP_REPORT
    echo "- [ ] Same approaches being repeated?" >> $LOOP_REPORT
    echo "- [ ] Each attempt providing less new information?" >> $LOOP_REPORT
    echo "- [ ] Running out of systematic approaches?" >> $LOOP_REPORT

    echo "- [ ] Issue blocking progress on main objective?" >> $LOOP_REPORT
    echo "- [ ] Specialized knowledge domain expertise needed?" >> $LOOP_REPORT
}
```

## Phase 3: Collaboration Preparation

### Issue Classification

```bash
prepare_collaboration_request() {
    echo "" >> $LOOP_REPORT
    echo "=== COLLABORATION REQUEST PREPARATION ===" >> $LOOP_REPORT
    echo "Preparation Time: $(date)" >> $LOOP_REPORT
    echo "" >> $LOOP_REPORT
    
    echo "## Issue Classification" >> $LOOP_REPORT

    echo "- [ ] **Architecture Design Problem:** Structural or pattern-related issues" >> $LOOP_REPORT  
    echo "- [ ] **Platform Integration Problem:** OS, framework, or tool compatibility" >> $LOOP_REPORT
