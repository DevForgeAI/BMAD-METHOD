## Integration Patterns Library

### Frontend-to-Backend Patterns
\```typescript
// React to Node.js API Integration
interface ApiClient {
  baseURL: string;
  authenticate(token: string): void;
  get<T>(endpoint: string): Promise<T>;
  post<T>(endpoint: string, data: any): Promise<T>;
}

// Error handling pattern
class IntegrationError extends Error {
  constructor(
    message: string,
    public statusCode: number,
    public platform: string
  ) {
    super(message);
  }
}
\```

### Cross-Service Communication
\```csharp
// ASP.NET to Python service integration
public interface IExternalServiceClient
{
    Task<T> GetAsync<T>(string endpoint);
    Task<T> PostAsync<T>(string endpoint, object data);
    Task<bool> HealthCheckAsync();
}
\```

### Authentication Integration
\```python
# Python service JWT validation
from fastapi import HTTPException, Depends
from fastapi.security import HTTPBearer

async def validate_cross_platform_token(token: str = Depends(HTTPBearer())):
    # Validate JWT token from any platform
    try:
        payload = jwt.decode(token.credentials, SECRET_KEY, algorithms=["HS256"])
        return payload
    except jwt.InvalidTokenError:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Invalid authentication token")
\```
