## Technology-Specific Security Expertise

### Frontend Security (React/TypeScript)
```typescript
// XSS Prevention Patterns
const sanitizeInput = (input: string): string => {
  return DOMPurify.sanitize(input, {
    ALLOWED_TAGS: ['b', 'i', 'em', 'strong'],
    ALLOWED_ATTR: []
  });
};

// Content Security Policy Implementation
const cspConfig = {
  directives: {
    defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
    scriptSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
    styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
    imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https:"],
    connectSrc: ["'self'", "https://api.example.com"]
  }
};

// Secure Authentication State Management
interface AuthState {
  token: string | null;
  user: User | null;
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
}

const useSecureAuth = () => {
  const [authState, setAuthState] = useState<AuthState>({
    token: null,
    user: null,
    isAuthenticated: false
  });

  const login = async (credentials: LoginCredentials) => {
    try {
      const response = await secureApiCall('/auth/login', credentials);
      const { token, user } = response.data;
      
      // Store token securely (httpOnly cookie preferred)
      setSecureToken(token);
      setAuthState({ token, user, isAuthenticated: true });
    } catch (error) {
      handleAuthError(error);
    }
  };

  return { authState, login, logout };
};
```

### Backend Security (Node.js/Python/.NET)
```javascript
// Node.js Security Middleware
const securityMiddleware = {
  // Rate limiting
  rateLimit: rateLimit({
    windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
    max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
    message: 'Too many requests from this IP'
  }),

  // Input validation
  validateInput: (schema) => (req, res, next) => {
    const { error } = schema.validate(req.body);
    if (error) {
      return res.status(400).json({ error: error.details[0].message });
    }
    next();
  },

  // SQL Injection Prevention
  sanitizeQuery: (query, params) => {
    return db.query(query, params); // Use parameterized queries
  },

  // JWT Security
  verifyToken: (req, res, next) => {
    const token = req.headers.authorization?.split(' ')[1];
    if (!token) {
      return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Access denied' });
    }

    try {
      const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
      req.user = decoded;
      next();
    } catch (error) {
      res.status(400).json({ error: 'Invalid token' });
    }
  }
};

// Secure API Endpoint Example
app.post('/api/users', 
  securityMiddleware.rateLimit,
  securityMiddleware.validateInput(userSchema),
  securityMiddleware.verifyToken,
  async (req, res) => {
    try {
      const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(req.body.password, 12);
      const user = await User.create({
        ...req.body,
        password: hashedPassword
      });
      res.status(201).json({ user: omit(user, ['password']) });
    } catch (error) {
      res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal server error' });
    }
  }
);
```

### Database Security
```sql
-- Secure Database Patterns
-- 1. Parameterized Queries (Prevent SQL Injection)
PREPARE stmt FROM 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ? AND status = ?';
SET @email = 'user@example.com';
SET @status = 'active';
EXECUTE stmt USING @email, @status;

-- 2. Role-Based Access Control
CREATE ROLE app_read_only;
CREATE ROLE app_read_write;
CREATE ROLE app_admin;

GRANT SELECT ON database.* TO app_read_only;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON database.* TO app_read_write;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON database.* TO app_admin;

-- 3. Data Encryption at Rest
CREATE TABLE sensitive_data (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  encrypted_field VARBINARY(255),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- 4. Audit Trail Implementation
CREATE TABLE audit_log (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  table_name VARCHAR(50),
  operation VARCHAR(10),
  user_id INT,
  old_values JSON,
  new_values JSON,
  timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```
