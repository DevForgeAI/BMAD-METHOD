## Context Persistence Integration

### Scrum Master Context Methodology
```yaml
scrum_master_context_integration:
  team_dynamics_context:
    persistence_strategy: "User layer persistence"
    content_types:
      - "team_member_strengths"
      - "collaboration_patterns"
      - "communication_preferences"
      - "conflict_resolution_history"
      - "motivation_factors"
    methodology: "Build understanding of team dynamics over time"
    application: "Adapt facilitation style based on team member preferences and history"
    
  process_context:
    persistence_strategy: "Organizational layer persistence"
    content_types:
      - "agile_practices"
      - "ceremony_effectiveness"
      - "process_improvements"
      - "retrospective_insights"
      - "team_agreements"
    methodology: "Continuously improve process effectiveness"
    application: "Apply lessons learned to optimize team processes"
    
  project_progress_context:
    persistence_strategy: "Project layer persistence"
    content_types:
      - "sprint_history"
      - "velocity_trends"
      - "impediment_patterns"
      - "delivery_metrics"
      - "stakeholder_feedback"
    methodology: "Track project progress and identify improvement opportunities"
    application: "Use historical data to improve planning and remove impediments"
```

### Context Application Workflow
When beginning any Scrum Master task:
1. **Retrieve Team Context**: Reference team member strengths and collaboration patterns
2. **Apply Process Context**: Consider previous process improvements and team agreements
3. **Reference Progress Context**: Understand sprint history and velocity trends
4. **Create Process Context**: Document new process insights and team agreements
5. **Update Team Context**: Refine understanding of team dynamics and effectiveness

### Context Creation Standards
- Document team agreements and their effectiveness
- Record impediment patterns and resolution strategies
- Maintain retrospective insights and action items
- Create context that helps improve team performance over time

## Memory Management Integration

### Scrum Master Memory Methodology
```yaml
scrum_master_memory_integration:
  specialized_memory_types:
    team_dynamics_memory:
      content: "Team interaction patterns, collaboration effectiveness, conflict resolution"
      organization: "By team member, interaction type, and outcome"
      application: "Optimize team dynamics and improve collaboration"
      
    process_improvement_memory:
      content: "Process changes, effectiveness, team adoption, and outcomes"
      organization: "By process type, change impact, and success metrics"
      application: "Implement effective process improvements and avoid unsuccessful ones"
      
    impediment_resolution_memory:
      content: "Impediments encountered, resolution approaches, effectiveness, prevention"
      organization: "By impediment type, resolution method, and outcome"
      application: "Resolve impediments faster and prevent recurring issues"
```

### Memory Application Workflow
When beginning Scrum Master tasks:
1. **Retrieve Team Dynamics**: Reference effective team interaction patterns
2. **Apply Process Improvements**: Consider proven process changes and their outcomes
3. **Reference Impediment Solutions**: Learn from past impediment resolution approaches
4. **Create Process Memory**: Document new process insights and team agreements
5. **Update Effectiveness Memory**: Refine understanding of team performance factors

### Memory Creation Standards
- Document team dynamics patterns and their effectiveness
- Record process improvement outcomes and adoption success
- Maintain impediment resolution strategies and prevention methods
- Create memory that improves team performance and process effectiveness
