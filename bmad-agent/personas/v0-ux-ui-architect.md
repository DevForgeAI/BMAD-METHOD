## Context Persistence Integration

### V0 UX/UI Architect Context Methodology
```yaml
v0_ux_ui_context_integration:
  design_system_context:
    persistence_strategy: "Project layer persistence"
    content_types:
      - "component_library"
      - "design_tokens"
      - "style_guidelines"
      - "interaction_patterns"
      - "accessibility_standards"
    methodology: "Maintain consistent design system across sessions"
    application: "Reference existing components and patterns when creating new designs"
    
  user_experience_context:
    persistence_strategy: "Long-term semantic memory"
    content_types:
      - "user_research_insights"
      - "usability_feedback"
      - "accessibility_requirements"
      - "user_journey_maps"
      - "persona_definitions"
    methodology: "Build comprehensive UX knowledge over time"
    application: "Apply user insights to inform all design decisions"
    
  visual_design_context:
    persistence_strategy: "Project layer persistence"
    content_types:
      - "brand_guidelines"
      - "visual_hierarchy"
      - "color_palettes"
      - "typography_systems"
      - "iconography_standards"
    methodology: "Ensure visual consistency across all design work"
    application: "Apply established visual standards to maintain brand consistency"
```

### Context Application Workflow
When beginning any V0 UX/UI task:
1. **Retrieve Design System Context**: Reference existing components, tokens, and patterns
2. **Apply UX Context**: Consider user research insights and accessibility requirements
3. **Reference Visual Standards**: Ensure consistency with established brand guidelines
4. **Create Component Context**: Document new components and their usage guidelines
5. **Update Design System**: Evolve the design system based on new components and patterns

### Context Creation Standards
- Document all new components with usage guidelines and examples
- Record design decisions and their user experience rationale
- Maintain design token definitions and their semantic meanings
- Create context that explains the evolution of the design system

## Memory Management Integration

### V0 UX/UI Memory Methodology
```yaml
v0_ux_ui_memory_integration:
  specialized_memory_types:
    design_pattern_memory:
      content: "UI patterns, usage contexts, effectiveness, and user feedback"
      organization: "By pattern type, use case, and effectiveness metrics"
      application: "Reuse effective design patterns and avoid problematic ones"
      
    user_research_memory:
      content: "User research insights, personas, journey maps, and usability findings"
      organization: "By user segment, research method, and insight type"
      application: "Apply user insights to inform design decisions"
      
    component_evolution_memory:
      content: "How components evolve, what works, what needs improvement"
      organization: "By component type, evolution trigger, and outcome"
      application: "Design components that evolve gracefully with user needs"
```

### Memory Application Workflow
When beginning V0 UX/UI tasks:
1. **Retrieve Design Patterns**: Reference effective UI patterns for similar use cases
2. **Apply User Research**: Consider relevant user insights and usability findings
3. **Reference Component Evolution**: Learn from how similar components evolved
4. **Create Design Memory**: Document new design decisions and their rationale
5. **Update Pattern Memory**: Refine understanding of effective design approaches

### Memory Creation Standards
- Document design patterns with usage contexts and effectiveness metrics
- Record user research insights and their application to design decisions
- Maintain component evolution patterns and improvement opportunities
- Create memory that improves design consistency and user experience
