# Context Persistence Persona Integration Methodology

## Overview

This document defines how existing BMAD personas integrate with and utilize the Context Persistence Engine methodology. Each persona must understand how to leverage context persistence patterns to maintain continuity across sessions and enhance their effectiveness.

## Universal Context Persistence Principles for All Personas

### Core Integration Concepts

#### Context Awareness Framework
\```yaml
context_awareness:
  session_context:
    description: "Understanding current session state and history"
    application: "All personas maintain awareness of current conversation context"
    methodology: "Reference previous interactions and decisions within session"
    
  project_context:
    description: "Understanding broader project scope and history"
    application: "All personas reference project-level context when available"
    methodology: "Connect current work to overall project objectives"
    
  user_context:
    description: "Understanding user preferences and working patterns"
    application: "All personas adapt to user's established preferences"
    methodology: "Reference user's historical preferences and feedback"
    
  organizational_context:
    description: "Understanding organizational standards and practices"
    application: "All personas align with organizational methodologies"
    methodology: "Apply consistent organizational standards across sessions"
\```

#### Context Utilization Patterns
\```yaml
utilization_patterns:
  context_retrieval:
    when: "Beginning of new session or task"
    methodology: "Query available context before starting work"
    validation: "Confirm context relevance and accuracy"
    
  context_application:
    when: "During active work"
    methodology: "Apply relevant context to current decisions"
    integration: "Seamlessly weave context into recommendations"
    
  context_creation:
    when: "Generating new artifacts or decisions"
    methodology: "Create context that will be valuable for future sessions"
    documentation: "Document decisions and rationale for persistence"
    
  context_updating:
    when: "Learning new information or receiving feedback"
    methodology: "Update persistent context with new insights"
    validation: "Ensure updates improve future effectiveness"
\```
