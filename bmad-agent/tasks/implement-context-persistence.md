### Key Implementation Patterns

#### Context Serialization Pattern
\```python
def serialize_context(context_entity, options=None):
    """
    Serialize context entity for persistence
    """
    # Prepare context for serialization
    prepared_context = prepare_for_serialization(context_entity)
    
    # Apply serialization strategy
    serialized_data = apply_serialization_strategy(prepared_context, options)
    
    # Add integrity metadata
    packaged_data = add_integrity_metadata(serialized_data)
    
    return packaged_data
\```

#### Storage Abstraction Pattern
\```python
class ContextStorage:
    """
    Abstract interface for context storage implementations
    """
    
    def store_context(self, context_id, serialized_data, metadata):
        """Store serialized context data"""
        raise NotImplementedError
    
    def retrieve_context(self, context_id):
        """Retrieve serialized context data"""
        raise NotImplementedError
    
    def delete_context(self, context_id):
        """Delete stored context data"""
        raise NotImplementedError
\```

#### Restoration Workflow Pattern
\```python
def restore_context(context_id, restoration_options=None):
    """
    Restore context from persistent storage
    """
    # Locate context in storage
    storage_location = locate_context(context_id)
    
    # Retrieve serialized data
    serialized_data = retrieve_from_storage(storage_location)
    
    # Validate data integrity
    validate_integrity(serialized_data)
    
    # Deserialize context
    context_entity = deserialize_context(serialized_data)
    
    # Reconstruct relationships
    restored_context = reconstruct_relationships(context_entity)
    
    # Activate context
    return activate_context(restored_context)
\```
