# BMAD Persona Registry System

## Overview

The BMAD Persona Registry is a comprehensive system for managing, discovering, and coordinating all available personas within the BMAD Method ecosystem. It provides intelligent persona selection, lifecycle management, and workflow optimization.

## Intelligent Persona Selection

### Request Analysis Engine
\```markdown
The orchestrator analyzes user requests using:

1. **Keyword Matching:** Identifies domain-specific terms and technical concepts
2. **Intent Recognition:** Understands the type of work being requested
3. **Complexity Assessment:** Evaluates the sophistication level required
4. **Context Awareness:** Considers current project phase and existing artifacts
```

### Capability Matching Matrix
\```yaml
capability_mapping:
  "create api documentation":
    primary: "technical_documentation_architect"
    secondary: ["architect", "cross_platform_integration_specialist"]
    
  "performance optimization":
    primary: "performance_optimization_specialist"
    secondary: ["architect", "advanced_troubleshooting_specialist"]
    
  "security review":
    primary: "security_integration_specialist"
    secondary: ["polyglot_code_review_specialist", "architect"]
    
  "enterprise strategy":
    primary: "enterprise_architecture_consultant"
    secondary: ["product_manager", "architect"]
    
  "troubleshoot complex issue":
    primary: "advanced_troubleshooting_specialist"
    secondary: ["performance_optimization_specialist", "architect"]
```

## Persona Lifecycle Management

### Loading and Initialization
\```markdown
1. **Persona Discovery:** Scan AgentConfig for available personas
2. **Capability Registration:** Register persona specializations and dependencies
3. **Health Validation:** Verify persona configuration integrity
4. **Resource Allocation:** Prepare persona-specific resources and templates
5. **Ready State:** Mark persona as available for activation
```

### Context Management
\```markdown
1. **Context Preservation:** Maintain conversation context during persona switches
2. **State Transfer:** Pass relevant information between related personas
3. **Workflow Continuity:** Ensure seamless transitions in multi-persona workflows
4. **Memory Management:** Optimize context storage and retrieval
```

### Performance Monitoring
\```yaml
performance_metrics:
  persona_loading_time: "< 1 second"
  context_transfer_time: "< 500ms"
  memory_usage_per_persona: "< 50MB"
  concurrent_persona_limit: 3
  health_check_interval: "30 seconds"
```

## Workflow Optimization

### Recommended Persona Sequences
\```yaml
workflow_patterns:
  project_initiation:
    sequence: ["analyst", "product_manager", "architect", "design_architect"]
    parallel_options: ["technical_documentation_architect", "security_integration_specialist"]
    
  feature_development:
    sequence: ["product_owner", "scrum_master", "v0_ux_ui_architect"]
    validation: ["polyglot_code_review_specialist", "performance_optimization_specialist"]
    
  system_integration:
    sequence: ["cross_platform_integration_specialist", "architect"]
    support: ["devops_documentation_specialist", "security_integration_specialist"]
    
  enterprise_transformation:
    sequence: ["enterprise_architecture_consultant", "product_manager", "architect"]
    specialists: ["performance_optimization_specialist", "security_integration_specialist"]
    
  issue_resolution:
    sequence: ["advanced_troubleshooting_specialist"]
    escalation: ["performance_optimization_specialist", "security_integration_specialist", "architect"]
```

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Persona Health Monitoring
\```markdown
1. **Configuration Validation:** Verify persona files and dependencies
2. **Resource Availability:** Check template and checklist accessibility
3. **Performance Monitoring:** Track response times and resource usage
4. **Error Detection:** Identify and log persona-specific issues
5. **Automatic Recovery:** Attempt persona restart or fallback options
```

### Fallback Strategies
\```yaml
fallback_options:
  persona_unavailable:
    action: "suggest_alternative_persona"
    alternatives: ["similar_capability_personas", "core_persona_fallback"]
    
  configuration_error:
    action: "reload_persona_config"
    retry_attempts: 3
    fallback: "base_orchestrator_mode"
    
  performance_degradation:
    action: "optimize_resource_allocation"
    options: ["reduce_concurrent_personas", "clear_context_cache"]
    
  dependency_failure:
    action: "resolve_dependencies"
    strategy: ["load_required_personas", "suggest_workflow_modification"]
```

## Integration Points

### Cross-Persona Collaboration
\```markdown
The registry facilitates collaboration between personas through:

1. **Shared Context:** Common understanding of project artifacts and goals
2. **Handoff Protocols:** Standardized information transfer between personas
3. **Collaborative Workflows:** Multi-persona task execution and coordination
4. **Quality Validation:** Cross-persona review and validation processes
```

  ide_environments:
    - "cursor_ai"
    - "claude_code"
    - "cline"
    - "roocode"
