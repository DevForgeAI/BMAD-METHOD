# Story PR0.1: Claude Code Hooks Integration

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** BMAD-Method user running Claude Code CLI,
**I want** automatic quality enforcement through native hooks,
**so that** I get zero-friction quality validation without manual commands

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Context automatically loads from active story files on each prompt
2. Pre-write validation blocks simulation patterns before they're written
3. Progress tracking updates story files without manual intervention
4. Quality monitoring provides real-time feedback after code changes
5. Session summaries generate actionable next steps on exit
6. Installation detects Claude Code environment and configures hooks
7. Performance impact remains under 500ms for hook operations
8. Backward compatibility maintained for non-Claude Code environments
9. Zero impact on Cursor, Windsurf, Roo, Cline, GitHub Copilot users
10. Hooks remain completely isolated in tools/claude-code-hooks directory
11. No modifications to core BMAD files (agents, tasks, workflows)
12. Manual opt-in required even for Claude Code users

## Dev Notes
### CRITICAL: Working Directory
**ALL CHANGES MUST BE MADE IN: `C:\Projects\BMAD-Method\src\BMAD-Method-main\`**
- This is the clean upstream fork for PR submission
- Do NOT modify files in the root `C:\Projects\BMAD-Method\` directory
- Create all new files under `src\BMAD-Method-main\tools\claude-code-hooks\`

### Hook Architecture
- Hooks stored in `tools/claude-code-hooks/`
- Each hook is a separate JavaScript file
- Hooks integrate with existing BMAD quality framework
- Context shared via `.workspace/` directory when available

### Multi-Agent Collaboration Foundation
PR0 creates the foundation for multi-agent workspace by:
- Establishing `.workspace/` directory structure
- Creating agent-specific context files
- Implementing file-based message passing
- Supporting concurrent session tracking
- Enabling role-based context filtering

### Integration Points
- Reality audit system from `bmad-core/tasks/reality-audit-comprehensive.md`
- Story file format from existing BMAD stories
- Quality scoring system (A-F grades)
- Existing BMAD agent commands
- Core Development Cycle from `bmad-core/user-guide.md`
- Story sharding from PO agent
- devLoadAlwaysFiles from `core-config.yaml`

### Workflow Integration
PR0 Hooks activate AFTER the Planning Workflow (Analyst → PM → Architect → PO) is complete.

#### Planning Phase (No Hooks Needed)
- Happens in Web UI with powerful models
- Analyst: Research, brainstorming, project brief
- PM: Creates PRD with epics/stories
- Architect: Creates architecture
- PO: Shards documents for IDE work

#### Development Phase (Hooks Enhance This)
Hooks enhance the Core Development Cycle by:
1. Auto-loading sharded story context when Dev starts
2. Enforcing story requirements during implementation
3. Updating story progress without manual commands
4. Providing QA handoff summaries automatically
5. Respecting devLoadAlwaysFiles configuration
6. Supporting SM → Dev → QA workflow transitions

### Testing Standards
- Test files in `tools/claude-code-hooks/__tests__/`
- Use Jest for unit testing
- Mock Claude Code environment variables
- Test both enabled and disabled states
- Verify no impact when not in Claude Code

### CRITICAL: Dependencies Policy
**USE ONLY NODE.JS BUILT-IN MODULES - NO EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES**
- Use `fs` (built-in) NOT `fs-extra`
- Use `path` (built-in) for file operations
- Use `child_process` (built-in) if needed
- Use `util.promisify` for async operations
- NO npm packages beyond what BMAD already uses

Example replacements:
```javascript
// WRONG: fs-extra
const fs = require('fs-extra');
await fs.ensureDir(dirPath);

// CORRECT: Built-in fs
const fs = require('fs').promises;
await fs.mkdir(dirPath, { recursive: true });
```

## Change Log
