## 🛠️ Enhanced Commands

### 💻 Developer Agent (James)
```bash
*develop-story        # Systematic story implementation with dual-track progress updates
*reality-audit        # Comprehensive quality validation with regression analysis  
*build-context        # Pre-fix investigation with git history and risk assessment
*escalate            # External AI collaboration when stuck in loops
```

### 🧪 QA Agent (Quinn)
```bash
*reality-audit        # Manual quality audit with regression prevention analysis
*audit-validation     # Auto-remediation audit with guaranteed fix story generation
*create-remediation   # Generate regression-safe fix stories with pattern compliance
*story-code-audit     # Cross-reference completed stories vs actual codebase implementation
*Push2Git            # Override safety gates to push despite quality issues
```

## ⚡ Automation Highlights

### 🤖 What Happens Automatically

**🔄 Loop Detection (After 3 Failed Attempts)**
- Tracks solution attempts per specific issue
- Generates copy-paste collaboration prompts for Gemini/GPT-4/Claude
- Resets counters on successful progress

**🤖 Automatic Remediation Execution (Zero Manual Commands)**
- Quality issues detected → Remediation stories generated automatically
- Oversized stories (>8 tasks) → Auto-split into manageable pieces  
- Mixed concerns → Surgical fix stories created immediately
- No "run this command next" - solutions delivered ready-to-use

**📤 Git Push (Perfect Completion Only)**
- Story 100% complete + Quality scores met + Clean build + Zero simulation patterns
- Intelligent commit messages with quality metrics
- `*Push2Git` available for manual override when needed

**📋 Dual-Track Progress (During Development)**
- Automatic story file checkbox updates `[x]` after each task completion
- Incremental File List updates with new/modified/deleted files
- Validation gates prevent proceeding without story file updates

**🔧 Task Execution Enforcement (Reliability)**
- Mandatory execution of configured task files, not generic Task tool
- Pre-execution validation ensures task files exist and are accessible  
- Prevents automation workflow bypass that causes quality framework failures

**📊 Automatic Options Presentation (No User Confusion)**
- Grade A-F options automatically presented based on audit results
- Effort estimates and specific actions included for each option
- Clear next steps eliminate "what should I do?" moments

**🎛️ Role-Optimized LLM Settings (Maximum Agent Performance)**
- Development agents: Low temperature (0.3-0.4) for precise code generation
- Creative agents: Higher temperature (0.75-0.8) for innovative ideation
- Technical agents: Balanced settings (0.5-0.6) for structured creativity
- Each agent fine-tuned for their specific responsibilities and output quality

## 🎯 Quality Scoring System

### 📊 Composite Score Breakdown
- **🔍 Simulation Reality (40%)** - Pattern detection + build validation
- **🛡️ Regression Prevention (35%)** - Pattern consistency + architectural compliance  
- **⚖️ Technical Debt Prevention (25%)** - Code quality + maintainability

### 🎖️ Grade Thresholds
| Grade | Score | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 🟢 **A** | 90-100 | Exceptional - Auto-push eligible |
| 🔵 **B** | 80-89 | Good - Meets quality gates |
| 🟡 **C** | 70-79 | Acceptable - Needs improvement |
| 🟠 **D** | 60-69 | Poor - Remediation required |
| 🔴 **F** | <60 | Failing - Major issues detected |
