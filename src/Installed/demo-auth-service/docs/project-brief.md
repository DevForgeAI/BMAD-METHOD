# Authentication Service - PR0 Reality Enforcement Demo

## Project Overview
A complete authentication service that demonstrates how PR0's Claude Code hooks transform typical "stub-first" security implementations into immediate, working authentication - because security can't be a TODO.

## The Problem PR0 Solves
Traditional authentication development:
1. Create auth endpoints with `// TODO: implement actual auth`
2. Return hardcoded tokens for "testing"
3. Skip password hashing "for now"
4. Mock user validation
5. **Result**: Security vulnerabilities from day one

PR0-enforced development:
1. Can't create auth stubs → Must implement real authentication
2. Can't mock tokens → Must generate proper tokens
3. Can't skip hashing → Must implement password security
4. Can't fake validation → Must check credentials properly
5. **Result**: Secure authentication from day one

## Key PR0 Demonstrations

### Security Can't Be TODO'd
```javascript
// ❌ PR0 BLOCKS: Security stubs
function authenticate(username, password) {
  // TODO: implement real authentication
  return { token: 'fake-token' };
}

// ✅ PR0 REQUIRES: Real security
function authenticate(username, password) {
  const user = users.find(u => u.username === username);
  if (!user || !verifyPassword(password, user.hashedPassword)) {
    throw new AuthError('Invalid credentials');
  }
  return { token: generateSecureToken(user) };
}
```

### Complete Implementation Benefits
- No hardcoded test tokens in production
- Password hashing implemented immediately
- Session management works from start
- Security best practices enforced

## Target Audience
- Security-conscious developers
- Teams tired of "we'll add security later"
- Claude Code users wanting quality enforcement
- Anyone who's inherited a codebase full of auth TODOs

## Success Metrics
- Zero authentication stubs
- All passwords properly hashed
- Real token generation/validation
- Complete session management
- No security TODOs in codebase
