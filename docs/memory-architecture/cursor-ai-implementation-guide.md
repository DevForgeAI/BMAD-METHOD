## BMAD Memory-Enhanced Development Workflow

### Example 1: BMAD Component Development

```
User: "Help me create a reusable Button component using BMAD methodology"

Cursor AI: "/bmad-recall 'component'

Found relevant BMAD memories:
- bmad_mem_002: Component composition over inheritance

Based on established BMAD patterns, I'll create a Button component using composition.

```tsx
// src/components/Button/Button.tsx
// Following BMAD composition pattern (bmad_mem_002)

import React from 'react';
import { ButtonVariant, ButtonSize } from './Button.types';
import { useButtonStyles } from './Button.hooks';

interface ButtonProps {
  variant?: ButtonVariant;
  size?: ButtonSize;
  disabled?: boolean;
  children: React.ReactNode;
  onClick?: () => void;
}

export const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({
  variant = 'primary',
  size = 'medium',
  disabled = false,
  children,
  onClick
}) => {
  const styles = useButtonStyles({ variant, size, disabled });
  
  return (
    <button
      className={styles}
      disabled={disabled}
      onClick={onClick}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
};
```

[AUTO-CREATED] bmad_mem_003: PATTERN
CONTENT: BMAD Button component uses composition with variant and size props
IMPORTANCE: 0.7
TAGS: bmad, methodology, button, component, composition, variants
FILE: .bmad-memory/storage/pattern/bmad_mem_003.json

This follows our established BMAD composition pattern and creates a reusable, configurable Button component.
```

### Example 2: BMAD Problem Solving

```
User: "I'm getting TypeScript errors in my component props"

Cursor AI: "/bmad-recall 'typescript'

Found relevant BMAD memory:
- bmad_mem_001: TypeScript with strict mode for type safety

Let me analyze the TypeScript errors in context of our BMAD methodology.

[Analyzes the specific errors in the codebase]

The issue is with prop type definitions. Based on our BMAD TypeScript approach (strict mode), here's the solution:

```tsx
// Fix: Define proper interface for component props
interface ComponentProps {
  title: string;
  items: Array<{
    id: string;
    name: string;
    value: number;
  }>;
  onItemClick: (id: string) => void;
}

// Use the interface in your component
export const Component: React.FC<ComponentProps> = ({ title, items, onItemClick }) => {
  // Component implementation
};
```

[AUTO-CREATED] bmad_mem_004: SOLUTION
CONTENT: BMAD TypeScript solution - Define explicit interfaces for component props to satisfy strict mode
IMPORTANCE: 0.8
TAGS: bmad, methodology, typescript, props, interfaces, strict-mode
FILE: .bmad-memory/storage/solution/bmad_mem_004.json
CONTEXT: TypeScript error resolution, component props

This solution follows our BMAD TypeScript methodology and will prevent similar issues in the future.
```

### Example 3: BMAD Architecture Decision

```
User: "Should we use Redux or Context API for state management?"

Cursor AI: "/bmad-recall 'state management'

No existing BMAD memories found for state management. Let me help you make this architectural decision using BMAD methodology.

Based on your project structure and requirements, here's my BMAD analysis:

Project Size: Medium (component library)
Complexity: Moderate
Team Size: Small to medium

BMAD RECOMMENDATION: Start with Context API, migrate to Redux if complexity grows

Reasoning:
1. Context API aligns with BMAD simplicity principle
2. Easier to implement and maintain initially
3. Can be refactored to Redux later if needed
4. Better for component library use case

[AUTO-CREATED] bmad_mem_005: DECISION
CONTENT: BMAD state management decision - Use Context API for initial implementation, consider Redux for complex state
IMPORTANCE: 0.9
TAGS: bmad, methodology, state-management, context-api, redux, architecture
FILE: .bmad-memory/storage/decision/bmad_mem_005.json
CONTEXT: Architecture planning, state management selection

This BMAD decision will guide our state management approach and can be referenced for future projects.
```

import React from 'react';

interface {{ComponentName}}Props {
  // Define props following BMAD TypeScript patterns (bmad_mem_001)
}

export const {{ComponentName}}: React.FC<{{ComponentName}}Props> = ({
  // Destructure props
}) => {
  // Component implementation following BMAD composition pattern (bmad_mem_002)
  
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Component JSX */}
    </div>
  );
};

TAGS: bmad, methodology, form, validation, hooks, typescript
```

### BMAD + Cursor Chat

```
User: "Explain this code in context of our BMAD methodology"

Cursor AI: "/bmad-recall 'methodology'

Analyzing code against established BMAD patterns:

This code follows several BMAD principles:
1. Component composition (bmad_mem_002) 
2. TypeScript strict typing (bmad_mem_001) 
3. Variant-based design (bmad_mem_003) 

The implementation aligns with our BMAD methodology by:
- Using composition over inheritance
- Maintaining type safety
- Following established patterns

This is a good example of BMAD methodology in practice.
```
