## Web Environment Integration

### Setup Instructions

1. **Access the Web Orchestrator**
   - Navigate to your preferred AI platform (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
   - Create a new conversation

2. **Load the v0 UX/UI Architect Persona**
   - Copy the contents of `bmad-agent/personas/v0-ux-ui-architect.md`
   - Paste as your first message to the AI

3. **Activate the Persona**
   - Use an activation phrase: "I need Veronica to help with UI design"
   - Provide initial context about your project

### Usage in Web Environment

```
"Veronica, I need a modern dashboard design for a SaaS application with the following components:
- Navigation sidebar
- Summary statistics
- Activity feed
- User profile section

Our brand colors are blue (#1a73e8) and gray (#f1f3f4), and we follow Material Design principles."
```

### Output Handling

- **Design Specifications**: Copy and save to your design documentation
- **Component Code**: Copy and integrate into your codebase
- **Visual Descriptions**: Use as reference for design implementation

## IDE Environment Integration

### Methodology Loading Process
1. **Load Persona Documentation**
   - Copy `bmad-agent/personas/v0-ux-ui-architect.ide.md` content
   - Reference UX/UI task library and templates
   - Load quality checklists for validation

2. **Context Configuration**
   ```
   Load Victor (IDE-based v0 UX/UI Architect) persona
   Reference component creation tasks and templates
   Apply design system quality standards
   ```

### Usage in IDE Environment

```
"Victor, I need you to implement a responsive navigation component using React and Tailwind CSS.
It should collapse to a hamburger menu on mobile and show full navigation on desktop.
Please include accessibility features and proper keyboard navigation."
```

## Design System Integration

### Integrating with Existing Design Systems

1. **Documentation Preparation**
   - Gather design system documentation
   - Identify component patterns and styles
   - Document design tokens (colors, typography, spacing)

2. **Persona Configuration**
   - Provide design system documentation to the persona
   - Specify design token usage requirements
   - Define component naming conventions

3. **Component Creation Process**
   - Request components that follow design system patterns
   - Validate generated components against design system
   - Document any extensions or modifications

### Creating a New Design System

1. **Foundation Definition**
   - Define color palette, typography, and spacing
   - Establish naming conventions
   - Create design tokens

2. **Core Component Creation**
   - Use v0 UX/UI Architect to generate base components
   - Document component variants and states
   - Establish component hierarchy

3. **System Documentation**
   - Create usage guidelines
   - Document component specifications
   - Establish contribution guidelines

## BMAD Method Workflow Integration

### Integration Points

1. **After Analyst Phase**
   - Transform project brief into visual concepts
   - Create rapid prototypes for validation
   - Refine requirements through visual exploration

2. **During PM Phase**
   - Enhance PRD with visual designs
   - Create UI mockups for feature specifications
   - Develop interactive prototypes for stakeholder communication

3. **Parallel to Architecture Phase**
   - Ensure technical feasibility of designs
   - Align component design with system architecture
   - Refine based on technical constraints

4. **Before Development**
   - Generate implementation-ready component code
   - Create detailed component documentation
   - Provide integration guidance

## Third-Party Tool Integration

### Design Tools

- **Figma**: Export designs as Figma-compatible formats
- **Sketch**: Generate designs that can be imported into Sketch
- **Adobe XD**: Create designs compatible with XD workflows

### Development Frameworks

- **React**: Generate React components with proper hooks and patterns
- **Vue**: Create Vue components following best practices
- **Angular**: Develop Angular components with proper structure
- **Svelte**: Build efficient Svelte components

### CSS Frameworks

- **Tailwind CSS**: Generate components using Tailwind utility classes
- **Bootstrap**: Create components following Bootstrap patterns
- **Material UI**: Develop components using Material Design principles
- **Styled Components**: Build components with CSS-in-JS approach

## Configuration Options

### Persona Configuration

| Option | Description | Default | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|---------|
| `designSystem` | Preferred design system | None | "Material Design" |
| `colorPalette` | Brand color palette | None | "#1a73e8, #f1f3f4" |
| `framework` | Frontend framework | React | "Vue" |
| `cssApproach` | CSS methodology | Tailwind | "Styled Components" |
| `accessibilityLevel` | WCAG compliance level | AA | "AAA" |

### Example Configuration

```yaml
v0_ux_ui_architect:
