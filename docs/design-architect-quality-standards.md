# Design Architect - Quality Standards

## Overview

This document defines comprehensive quality standards for the **Design Architect** persona in the BMAD Method. These standards ensure consistent, accessible, and scalable design system implementations that meet business objectives and user needs.

## Quality Framework

### Quality Dimensions

The Design Architect quality assessment framework evaluates deliverables across six key dimensions:

1. **Design System Consistency** (25%)
2. **Accessibility Compliance** (20%)
3. **User Experience Quality** (20%)
4. **Technical Implementation** (15%)
5. **Documentation Quality** (10%)
6. **Brand Alignment** (10%)

### Quality Scoring

Each dimension is evaluated on a 5-point scale:
- **5 - Exceptional**: Exceeds all standards and best practices
- **4 - Excellent**: Meets all standards with minor enhancements
- **3 - Good**: Meets minimum standards with some improvements needed
- **2 - Fair**: Below standards, requires significant improvement
- **1 - Poor**: Does not meet standards, requires complete rework

**Overall Quality Score** = (Dimension Score  Weight)

### Quality Thresholds

- **Release Ready**:  4.0 overall score
- **Review Required**: 3.0 - 3.9 overall score
- **Significant Rework**: 2.0 - 2.9 overall score
- **Complete Rework**: < 2.0 overall score
