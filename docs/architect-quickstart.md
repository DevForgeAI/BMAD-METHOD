# System Architect (Fred) Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with Fred, the System Architect persona, in just 5 minutes. This guide provides everything you need to start designing robust, scalable system architectures.

## 1. Choose Your Environment

Fred can be used in two environments:

### Web Environment (Fred)
- Use with ChatGPT, Claude, or other web-based AI platforms
- Ideal for architectural planning and system design
- No setup required

### IDE Environment (Fred)
- Use with Cursor AI, Claude Code, Cline, or Roocode
- Ideal for implementation-focused architectural guidance
- Requires minimal setup

## 2. Activate the Persona

### Web Environment
1. Copy the contents of `bmad-agent/personas/architect.md`
2. Paste as your first message to the AI
3. Use an activation phrase: "I need Fred to help design the system architecture"

### IDE Environment
1. Copy the `bmad-agent` folder to your project root
2. Reference the persona file in your IDE's AI feature
3. Use an activation phrase: "Fred, help me architect this system"

## 3. Provide Clear Requirements

For best architectural guidance, include:

- **Project Overview**: What you're building and why
- **Functional Requirements**: Key features and capabilities
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance, scalability, security needs
- **Technical Constraints**: Existing systems, technology preferences, budget
- **Quality Attributes**: Availability, reliability, maintainability targets

### Example Prompt

```
Fred, I need to design the architecture for a real-time chat application with the following requirements:

Functional Requirements:
- Support 1-on-1 and group messaging
- File sharing and media uploads
- User presence indicators
- Message history and search

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Support 50,000 concurrent users
- Messages delivered within 100ms
- 99.9% uptime requirement
- End-to-end encryption for security

Technical Constraints:
- Team experienced with Node.js and React
- Prefer cloud-native solutions
- Budget allows for managed services
- Must integrate with existing user authentication system

Quality Attributes:
- High scalability and performance
- Strong security and privacy
- Easy to maintain and extend
```

## 4. Review and Iterate

1. Review Fred's initial architectural recommendations
2. Ask clarifying questions about specific components
3. Request alternatives for different trade-offs
4. Validate against your requirements and constraints

## 5. Implement and Validate

1. Use the architectural documentation for implementation planning
2. Share with your development team
3. Validate architectural decisions during implementation
4. Iterate based on real-world feedback

## Example: Designing a Microservices Architecture

### Step 1: Activate Fred

"I need Fred to help design a microservices architecture for an e-commerce platform."

### Step 2: Provide Requirements

"We need to build a scalable e-commerce platform with user management, product catalog, shopping cart, order processing, and payment handling. It should support 10,000+ concurrent users, integrate with multiple payment gateways, and maintain 99.9% uptime."

### Step 3: Review Initial Architecture

Fred will provide a comprehensive architectural design including:

- **Service Boundaries**: User Service, Product Service, Cart Service, Order Service, Payment Service
- **Communication Patterns**: REST APIs for synchronous communication, message queues for async processing
- **Data Strategy**: Database per service pattern with eventual consistency
- **Security Architecture**: API Gateway with JWT authentication, service-to-service encryption
- **Scalability Patterns**: Auto-scaling groups, load balancers, caching layers

### Step 4: Refine the Design

"Fred, how would you handle inventory consistency across the Product and Order services? Also, what's your recommendation for handling payment failures?"

### Step 5: Implementation Planning

Fred provides detailed implementation guidance:

```yaml
# Example Architecture Output
services:
  user-service:
    responsibilities: ["Authentication", "User Profiles", "Preferences"]
    database: "PostgreSQL"
    scaling: "Horizontal with load balancer"
    
  product-service:
    responsibilities: ["Product Catalog", "Inventory Management", "Search"]
    database: "PostgreSQL + Elasticsearch"
    scaling: "Read replicas + caching"
    
  order-service:
    responsibilities: ["Order Processing", "Order History", "Inventory Reservation"]
    database: "PostgreSQL"
    messaging: "RabbitMQ for order events"
    
  payment-service:
    responsibilities: ["Payment Processing", "Refunds", "Payment History"]
    database: "PostgreSQL"
    external_integrations: ["Stripe", "PayPal"]

infrastructure:
  api_gateway: "Kong or AWS API Gateway"
  load_balancer: "Application Load Balancer"
  caching: "Redis for session and product data"
  monitoring: "Prometheus + Grafana"
  logging: "ELK Stack"
```

## Common Architectural Patterns

### Microservices
- **When to use**: Complex domains, large teams, independent scaling needs
- **Key considerations**: Service boundaries, data consistency, communication patterns

### Event-Driven Architecture
- **When to use**: Real-time processing, loose coupling, scalable systems
- **Key considerations**: Event schema design, message ordering, error handling

### Serverless
- **When to use**: Variable workloads, rapid development, cost optimization
- **Key considerations**: Cold starts, vendor lock-in, monitoring complexity

### Monolithic
- **When to use**: Simple domains, small teams, rapid prototyping
- **Key considerations**: Modular design, deployment strategies, scaling limitations

## Quick Reference Commands

### Architecture Analysis
```
"Fred, analyze the pros and cons of [architectural pattern] for [use case]"
"What are the trade-offs between [option A] and [option B] for [requirement]?"
```

### Technology Selection
```
"Fred, recommend technologies for [specific requirement] considering [constraints]"
"Compare [technology A] vs [technology B] for [use case]"
```

### Scalability Planning
```
"Fred, how would you scale [system component] to handle [performance requirement]?"
"Design a caching strategy for [specific use case]"
```

### Security Architecture
```
"Fred, design security architecture for [system type] with [compliance requirements]"
"How would you implement authentication and authorization for [use case]?"
```
