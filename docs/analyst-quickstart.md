## Practical Example: E-commerce Mobile App Analysis

### Scenario Setup
```markdown
**Challenge**: "Our e-commerce conversion rates are declining on mobile devices"
**Goal**: Understand the problem and develop actionable recommendations
**Timeline**: 2 weeks for initial analysis
**Stakeholders**: Product Manager, UX Team, Development Team
```

### Working Session Example

#### Phase 1: Problem Analysis (Brainstorming Mode)
```markdown
Analyst: "Let's start by exploring this conversion rate challenge. I'll guide us through some structured brainstorming to uncover potential root causes and solutions."

Key Questions Asked:
- "What specific metrics are declining? (conversion rate, cart abandonment, checkout completion?)"
- "When did the decline start? Any correlation with app updates or market changes?"
- "What's different about mobile vs. desktop user behavior?"
- "What assumptions are we making about user intent and experience?"

Brainstorming Techniques Applied:
- "What if..." scenarios: "What if users are abandoning due to payment friction?"
- First principles: "What are the fundamental requirements for mobile commerce?"
- Analogical thinking: "How do successful mobile-first retailers handle this?"

Output: Prioritized list of potential causes and investigation areas
```

#### Phase 2: Research Planning (Research Mode)
```markdown
Analyst: "Based on our brainstorming, let's create a comprehensive research plan to validate our hypotheses."

# Project Brief: Mobile Conversion Rate Optimization

## Executive Summary
Mobile conversion rates have declined 15% over the past quarter. Research indicates three primary improvement areas: checkout process simplification, payment method expansion, and performance optimization.

## Problem Statement
Current mobile checkout process has 4.2 steps vs. industry average of 2.8 steps, contributing to 35% cart abandonment rate.

## Objectives
- Increase mobile conversion rate by 20% within 3 months
- Reduce cart abandonment rate to below 25%
- Improve mobile app store rating from 3.2 to 4.0+

## Scope
**Included:**
- Mobile app checkout flow redesign
- Payment method integration (Apple Pay, Google Pay)
- Performance optimization for key user flows

**Excluded:**
- Desktop website changes
- Inventory management system updates
- Marketing campaign modifications

## Success Metrics
- Mobile conversion rate: Target 20% improvement
- Cart abandonment rate: Target <25%
- Average checkout time: Target <90 seconds
- User satisfaction score: Target >4.0/5.0

## Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1** (Weeks 1-2): UX research and design
2. **Phase 2** (Weeks 3-6): Development and testing
3. **Phase 3** (Weeks 7-8): Launch and optimization

## Next Steps
1. UX/UI Architect: Create improved checkout flow designs
2. System Architect: Design payment integration architecture
3. Product Owner: Create detailed user stories and acceptance criteria
