## Effective Workflows in Roocode

### Component Creation Workflow

1. **Project Setup**:
   \`\`\`
   I'm starting a new frontend project. Let's set up a React application
   with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and a component-based architecture.
   \`\`\`

2. **Component Planning**:
   \`\`\`
   I need to create a comprehensive e-commerce product page with product
   details, image gallery, reviews, and related products. Let's plan the
   component structure.
   \`\`\`

3. **Implementation**:
   \`\`\`
   Let's implement the ProductDetail component first, focusing on the
   product information display and purchase options.
   \`\`\`

4. **Styling**:
   \`\`\`
   Now let's style the ProductDetail component using Tailwind CSS,
   ensuring it's responsive and visually appealing.
   \`\`\`

5. **Interactive Features**:
   \`\`\`
   Let's add interactive features to the product page, such as image zoom,
   color selection, and add-to-cart functionality.
   \`\`\`

### Design System Implementation

1. **Tailwind Configuration**:
   \`\`\`
   I need to set up a custom Tailwind configuration that implements
   our design system tokens for colors, typography, spacing, etc.
   \`\`\`

2. **Component Library Setup**:
   \`\`\`
   Let's create a component library structure using Storybook to
   document and showcase our design system components.
   \`\`\`

3. **Core Component Creation**:
   \`\`\`
   Let's implement the core components of our design system:
   Button, Input, Card, and Modal.
   \`\`\`

## Roocode-Specific Features

### Visual Editing

Roocode offers visual editing capabilities. Use this to your advantage:

\`\`\`
Can you help me design the layout for our product card component
using Roocode's visual editor?
\`\`\`

### Real-time Preview

Leverage Roocode's real-time preview feature:

\`\`\`
Let's implement this component and see how it looks in the preview
as we make changes.
\`\`\`

### Component Library Integration

Use Roocode's component library integration:

\`\`\`
I want to integrate Material UI components into our project.
Please show me how to set this up and customize the components
to match our design system.
\`\`\`

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Use Visual References**: Share design mockups or screenshots
2. **Start with Structure**: Focus on component structure before styling
3. **Leverage Roocode's Preview**: Use the preview to iterate quickly
4. **Build Incrementally**: Start with simple components and add complexity
5. **Document as You Go**: Add comments and documentation during development

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues in Roocode

   - Check for syntax errors
   - Verify component imports
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed

2. **Styling Inconsistencies**:
   - Confirm Tailwind configuration
   - Check for conflicting styles
   - Verify responsive breakpoints

3. **Component Integration Challenges**:
   - Ensure proper library installation
   - Check for version compatibility
   - Verify import paths
