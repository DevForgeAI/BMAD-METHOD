# BMAD Method: Video Walkthrough Script

## Introduction (30 seconds)
[OPENING SHOT: Developer at computer with split screen showing code and AI chat]

**Narrator**: "Welcome to the BMAD Method - a revolutionary approach to AI-assisted software development. In this quick walkthrough, we'll show you how to leverage specialized AI personas to streamline your development workflow and deliver high-quality software faster than ever before."

## What is the BMAD Method? (45 seconds)
[ANIMATION: Show the different personas and their roles in a development lifecycle]

**Narrator**: "The BMAD Method uses specialized AI personas, each an expert in their domain:
- John, the Product Manager, defines requirements
- Fred, the System Architect, designs system architecture
- Sarah, the Product Owner, creates sprint-ready user stories
- David, the Developer, implements code
- And several other specialized roles

These personas work together seamlessly, handling different aspects of the development lifecycle while maintaining consistency and quality."

## Getting Started (1 minute)
[SCREEN RECORDING: Show cloning repository and basic setup]

**Narrator**: "Getting started with the BMAD Method is simple. First, clone the BMAD Method repository to access all persona files and documentation. You can use the method in web-based AI platforms like ChatGPT or Claude, or in AI-enhanced IDEs like Cursor AI or Claude Code.

Let's set up our environment and activate our first persona..."

[SHOW: Terminal commands for cloning and basic setup]
```git clone https://github.com/bmadcode/BMAD-METHOD.git```

## Using Your First Persona (1 minute)
[SCREEN RECORDING: Activating John the Product Manager]

**Narrator**: "Let's start with John, our Product Manager persona. To activate John, we simply paste his persona file or use the activation phrase."

[SHOW: Pasting activation phrase]
```I need John to help define requirements for a user authentication feature.```

**Narrator**: "Now we provide context about what we're building..."

[SHOW: Typing project context]
```We need to add user authentication to our web application. Users should be able to register, log in, and recover their password.```

**Narrator**: "John analyzes our needs and creates a comprehensive PRD with user requirements, market analysis, and feature specifications."

[SHOW: John's output - a structured PRD]

## Multi-Persona Workflow (1 minute 30 seconds)
[SCREEN RECORDING: Passing outputs between personas]

**Narrator**: "The real power of the BMAD Method comes from chaining personas together. Let's take John's PRD to Fred, our System Architect."

[SHOW: Activating Fred and sharing the PRD]
```I need Fred to design the architecture for our authentication system based on these requirements.```

**Narrator**: "Fred creates a secure, scalable architecture design. Next, we take both the PRD and architecture to Sarah, our Product Owner."

[SHOW: Activating Sarah and sharing previous outputs]
```I need Sarah to create user stories based on this architecture and these requirements.```

**Narrator**: "Sarah breaks down the work into sprint-ready user stories with clear acceptance criteria. Finally, we take a story to David, our Developer."

[SHOW: Activating David and sharing a user story]
```I need David to implement this login functionality based on this user story.```

**Narrator**: "David provides production-ready code with tests and documentation, completing our workflow from idea to implementation."

## Advanced Tips (45 seconds)
[SCREEN RECORDING: Show advanced usage patterns]

**Narrator**: "Here are some advanced tips for getting the most out of the BMAD Method:

1. Maintain consistent project context across personas
2. Use the specialized checklists for quality assurance
3. Leverage IDE integrations for seamless development
4. Combine personas for complex problem-solving
