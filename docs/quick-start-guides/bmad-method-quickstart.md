# BMAD Method: 5-Minute Quick Start Guide

Welcome to the BMAD Method! This guide will get you up and running in just 5 minutes, allowing you to leverage the power of our specialized AI personas for your development workflow.

## What is the BMAD Method?

The BMAD Method is a **methodology framework** that structures AI-assisted software development using specialized personas, standardized workflows, and quality-driven processes. It's not a software application - it's a systematic approach to working with AI that ensures consistent, high-quality results.

### Key Components
- **Personas**: Specialized AI roles (PM, Architect, Developer, etc.)
- **Tasks**: Structured workflows for common development activities
- **Templates**: Standardized formats for deliverables
- **Checklists**: Quality validation frameworks

## Quick Setup (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Get the BMAD Method Files
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/bmadcode/BMAD-METHOD.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd BMAD-METHOD
```

### Step 2: Choose Your Environment
- **Web Environment**: Use with ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or other web-based AI platforms
- **IDE Environment**: Use with Cursor AI, VS Code, JetBrains IDEs, or other development environments

### Step 3: Understand the File Structure
```
bmad-agent/
 personas/          # AI persona definitions
 tasks/            # Structured task workflows
 templates/        # Document templates
 checklists/       # Quality validation checklists
```

## Your First BMAD Session (3 minutes)

### Example: Creating a User Authentication Feature

Let's walk through a complete example using multiple BMAD personas:

#### Step 1: Define Requirements with John (Product Manager)
```
Load John (Product Manager) from bmad-agent/personas/pm.md

I need to define requirements for a user authentication feature. 
The system should allow users to register, log in, and recover passwords.
Use the PRD template and follow PM quality standards.
```

**Expected Output**: Structured PRD with user needs, market analysis, feature requirements, and success metrics.

#### Step 2: Design Architecture with Fred (System Architect)
```
Load Fred (System Architect) from bmad-agent/personas/architect.md

Based on these requirements: [paste PRD summary]
Design a secure authentication system architecture.
Use the architecture template and follow security best practices.
```

**Expected Output**: Comprehensive architecture design with components, data flow, security considerations, and technical specifications.

#### Step 3: Create User Stories with Sarah (Product Owner)
```
Load Sarah (Product Owner) from bmad-agent/personas/po.md

Based on this architecture: [paste architecture summary]
Create sprint-ready user stories for the authentication feature.
Use the story template and include acceptance criteria.
```

**Expected Output**: Detailed user stories with acceptance criteria, definition of done, and sprint planning information.

#### Step 4: Implement with David (Developer)
```
Load David (Developer) from bmad-agent/personas/dev.ide.md

Based on this user story: [paste story]
Implement the login component using React and Node.js.
Follow development best practices and include tests.
```

**Expected Output**: Production-ready code with tests, documentation, and implementation notes.

## BMAD Personas Quick Reference

| Persona | Role | When to Use | Key Outputs |

| **John** | Product Manager | Define requirements, analyze market needs | PRDs, user research, roadmaps |
| **Fred** | System Architect | Design system architecture, technical planning | Architecture docs, technical specs |
| **Sarah** | Product Owner | Create user stories, manage backlog | User stories, acceptance criteria |
| **David** | Developer | Implement features, write code | Code, tests, technical documentation |
| **Veronica/Victor** | UX/UI Architect | Design interfaces, create components | UI designs, component specs |
| **Design Architect** | Design Systems | Create design systems, maintain consistency | Design tokens, component libraries |
| **Analyst** | Business Analyst | Research, analyze requirements | Analysis reports, recommendations |
| **SM** | Scrum Master | Facilitate processes, remove blockers | Process improvements, team guidance |

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Starting a New Project
```
Load John (Product Manager)
I need to create a new e-commerce platform for selling handmade crafts. 
Help me define the initial requirements and roadmap.
Use the PRD template and market analysis framework.
```

### 2. Designing System Architecture
```
Load Fred (System Architect)
Based on these requirements: [paste requirements]
Design a scalable microservices architecture for our e-commerce platform.
Include security, performance, and scalability considerations.
```

### 3. Creating Sprint-Ready Stories
```
Load Sarah (Product Owner)
Break down this feature: [paste feature description]
Into sprint-ready user stories with acceptance criteria.
Ensure stories are testable and deliverable within a sprint.
```

### 4. Implementing Features
```
Load David (Developer)
Implement this user story: [paste story]
Using React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL.
Include unit tests and API documentation.
```

### 5. Designing User Interfaces
```
Load Veronica (UX/UI Architect)
Design a product detail page based on these requirements: [paste requirements]
Create responsive components using our design system.
Include accessibility considerations.
```

## Quality Assurance with BMAD

### Using Quality Checklists
```
Validate this [deliverable type] against the [checklist name]:
[paste deliverable content]

Provide specific improvement recommendations and compliance score.
```

### Peer Review Simulation
```
Acting as [different persona], review this [deliverable] created by [original persona].
Check for completeness, quality, and adherence to best practices.
Provide constructive feedback and suggestions.
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Multi-Persona Collaboration
```
Transition from John (PM) to Fred (Architect).
Context: PRD for user authentication system
Next task: Design secure authentication architecture
Maintain consistency with PRD requirements and constraints.
```

### Context Preservation
```
Refresh project context:
- Project: E-commerce Platform
- Current phase: Architecture Design
- Active persona: Fred (Architect)
- Previous deliverable: PRD with authentication requirements
- Next milestone: Technical specification completion
```

### Template Customization
```
Adapt the PRD template for a mobile application project.
Include mobile-specific considerations:
- Platform requirements (iOS/Android)
- Performance constraints
- Offline functionality needs
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Specify the Persona
- Explicitly load the persona file you want to use
- Reference the persona by name in your prompts
- Maintain persona consistency throughout related tasks

### 2. Use Templates and Checklists
- Reference specific templates for structured outputs
- Apply quality checklists for validation
- Customize templates for project-specific needs

### 3. Maintain Context
- Provide clear project context when switching personas
- Reference previous deliverables when building on prior work
- Keep project goals and constraints visible

### 4. Validate Quality
- Use BMAD quality checklists consistently
- Conduct peer reviews using different personas
- Iterate based on feedback and quality assessments

## Troubleshooting

### Persona Not Responding Correctly
**Problem**: AI doesn't follow persona guidelines
**Solution**: 
- Explicitly reference the persona file path
- Provide clear context about the persona's role
- Include specific task requirements and templates

### Inconsistent Output Quality
**Problem**: Results vary significantly between sessions
**Solution**:
- Always use quality checklists for validation
- Reference specific templates and examples
- Maintain consistent prompt structure

### Context Loss
**Problem**: AI forgets project context during long sessions
**Solution**:
- Regularly refresh context with key project information
- Save important outputs as reference documents
- Use context preservation prompts
