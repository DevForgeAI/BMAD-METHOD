# Developer Success Metrics
**BMAD Method Documentation**

## Introduction

This document defines the success metrics for developers working within the BMAD Method framework. These metrics provide a comprehensive framework for measuring developer effectiveness, quality of work, and contribution to project success. The metrics are designed to be objective, actionable, and aligned with overall project goals.

## Success Metric Categories

Developer success is measured across five key categories:

1. **Delivery Performance** - Measures the developer's ability to deliver work efficiently
2. **Code Quality** - Assesses the quality of code produced
3. **Technical Impact** - Evaluates the developer's technical contribution to the project
4. **Collaboration** - Measures effectiveness in working with others
5. **Growth & Learning** - Tracks professional development and knowledge sharing

## Success Scoring System

### Calculation Method

Each metric is scored on a scale of 1-5:

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Exceptional - Significantly exceeds target |
| 4 | Exceeds - Above target |
| 3 | Meets - Meets target |
| 2 | Approaching - Below target but improving |
| 1 | Needs Improvement - Significantly below target |

The overall success score is calculated as a weighted average:

```
Overall Score = (Delivery Ã— 0.25) + (Quality Ã— 0.25) + (Impact Ã— 0.20) + 
                (Collaboration Ã— 0.15) + (Growth Ã— 0.15)
```

### Performance Levels

Based on the overall score, performance is classified into one of four levels:

| Level | Score Range | Description |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Distinguished | 4.5 - 5.0 | Exceptional performance across all dimensions |
| Strong | 3.5 - 4.4 | Strong performance exceeding expectations |
| Proficient | 3.0 - 3.4 | Solid performance meeting expectations |
| Developing | < 3.0 | Performance needs improvement in key areas |
