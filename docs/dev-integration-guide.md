# Developer (Dev) - Integration Guide

## Environment Setup

### IDE Environment Setup
The Developer persona is optimized for IDE-based development workflows with comprehensive tooling integration.

#### Initial Configuration
1. **Load persona configuration**
   ```bash
   # Copy persona files to IDE agent configuration
   cp bmad-agent/personas/dev.ide.md ~/.ai/personas/
   
   # Verify persona activation
   echo "Developer persona loaded: Expert Senior Software Engineer"
   ```

2. **Set up working directories**
   ```bash
   # Create essential project structure
   mkdir -p {docs/stories,docs/checklists,scripts,.ai}
   
   # Initialize debug log
   touch .ai/TODO-revert.md
   
   # Verify directory structure
   tree -L 2 docs/
   ```

3. **Configure development environment**
   ```bash
   # Install essential development tools
   npm install -g eslint prettier jest
   pip install pylint black pytest
   
   # Configure git hooks for quality checks
   git config core.hooksPath .githooks
   ```

### Web Environment Integration
For teams using web-based development environments, the Developer persona can be adapted for browser-based workflows.

#### Configuration Steps
1. **Access development workspace**
   ```
   Navigate to your development environment (GitHub Codespaces, GitPod, etc.)
   Load BMAD Method configuration
   Select "Developer" persona from available personas
   ```

2. **Verify integration points**
   ```
   Confirm access to story files in docs/stories/
   Validate connection to project management tools
   Test CI/CD pipeline integration
   ```

## BMAD Method Workflow Integration

### Phase 1: Story Assignment and Initialization

#### Entry Points
The Developer typically receives work through formal story assignment from Product Owners.

```markdown
# Story Assignment Process
1. **Story Creation**: Product Owner creates detailed story with acceptance criteria
2. **Technical Review**: System Architect validates technical feasibility
3. **Story Approval**: Story status updated to "Approved" and ready for development
4. **Developer Assignment**: Story assigned to specific developer for implementation
5. **Development Initiation**: Developer updates story status to "InProgress"
```

#### Handoff Procedures
```markdown
# From Product Owner (Sarah)
- Receive detailed user story with clear acceptance criteria
- Understand business context and user value proposition
- Clarify any ambiguous requirements or edge cases
- Confirm story priority and timeline expectations

# From System Architect (Fred)
- Review technical specifications and architecture guidelines
- Understand integration points and system constraints
- Validate technical approach and implementation strategy
- Confirm compliance with established architectural patterns

# From UX/UI Architect
- Receive design specifications and component requirements
- Understand user experience expectations and interaction patterns
- Clarify responsive design and accessibility requirements
- Coordinate on design system usage and component implementation
```

### Phase 2: Development Execution
