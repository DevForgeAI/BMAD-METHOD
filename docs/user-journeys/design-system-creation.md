## Detailed Journey Stages

### 1. Research & Planning Phase

#### Entry Point
- New product development initiative
- Redesign of existing product
- Consolidation of multiple product interfaces

#### Key Touchpoints
- **Interface Audit Template**: Systematic review of existing designs
- **BMAD UX/UI Architect Persona**: Guidance on design system strategy
- **Design Principles Framework**: Establishing core design values

#### Decision Points
-  **Design System Scope**: Determining breadth and depth of system
  - **Solution**: Scope definition worksheet with prioritization matrix
  - **Success Metric**: 95% of common UI patterns covered in initial release

#### Pain Points
-  **Inconsistent Existing Patterns**: Conflicting designs across products
  - **Solution**: Pattern reconciliation methodology
  - **Success Metric**: Consolidated pattern library with clear migration path
-  **Stakeholder Alignment**: Differing opinions on visual direction
  - **Solution**: Design direction workshop templates
  - **Success Metric**: Unanimous approval of design principles

### 2. Core System Development Phase

#### Key Touchpoints
- **Visual Language Definition**: Color, typography, spacing, and imagery
- **Component Design Process**: Creating foundational UI elements
- **Specification Documentation**: Detailed component requirements

#### Decision Points
-  **Component Granularity**: Atomic vs. composite component approach
  - **Solution**: Component hierarchy planning framework
  - **Success Metric**: 80% of interfaces buildable from component library

#### Pain Points
-  **Technical Feasibility**: Ensuring designs can be implemented efficiently
  - **Solution**: Developer collaboration workflow
  - **Success Metric**: Zero components rejected for technical limitations
-  **Accessibility Compliance**: Meeting accessibility standards
  - **Solution**: Accessibility checklist and testing protocol
  - **Success Metric**: 100% WCAG AA compliance for all components

### 3. Implementation Phase

#### Key Touchpoints
- **Component Library Development**: Building functional components
- **Documentation System**: Creating comprehensive guides
- **Usage Guidelines**: Establishing implementation standards

#### Decision Points
-  **Technology Stack**: Selecting frontend framework and tools
  - **Solution**: Technology evaluation framework
  - **Success Metric**: Component library compatible with all project requirements

#### Pain Points
-  **Documentation Thoroughness**: Balancing detail with usability
  - **Solution**: Tiered documentation approach (quick start to deep dive)
  - **Success Metric**: 90% of implementation questions answerable from docs
-  **Component Flexibility**: Making components adaptable without fragmentation
  - **Solution**: Prop structure and theming system guidelines
  - **Success Metric**: Components adaptable to all required use cases

### 4. Adoption & Maintenance Phase

#### Key Touchpoints
- **Training Program**: Educating teams on design system use
- **Implementation Monitoring**: Tracking adoption and consistency
- **Feedback Collection**: Gathering input for improvements

#### Decision Points
-  **Versioning Strategy**: Managing updates and breaking changes
  - **Solution**: Semantic versioning policy with migration guides
  - **Success Metric**: Zero production disruptions from design system updates

#### Pain Points
-  **Resistance to Adoption**: Teams preferring custom implementations
  - **Solution**: Adoption incentive program and success metrics
  - **Success Metric**: 90% adoption rate across new development
-  **System Maintenance**: Keeping system updated and relevant
  - **Solution**: Maintenance schedule and governance model
  - **Success Metric**: Design system updates released quarterly

## Next Steps in User Journey

After completing the design system creation journey, UX/UI Architects typically proceed to:

1. [Component Enhancement Journey](component-enhancement.md) - Expanding the component library
2. [Design System Evolution Journey](design-system-evolution.md) - Managing system growth
3. [Cross-Platform Adaptation Journey](cross-platform-adaptation.md) - Extending to mobile and other platforms
