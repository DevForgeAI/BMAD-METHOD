## Dev Notes

### Claude Code CLI Optimization Architecture

**Design Philosophy:**
- **Native Integration:** Workspace operations feel like built-in Claude Code CLI features
- **Zero Friction:** Automatic operations that don't require user intervention
- **Enhanced Experience:** Claude Code CLI users get premium workspace capabilities
- **Seamless Workflow:** Workspace features integrate naturally with existing Claude Code patterns

**Native Command Integration:**
```markdown
# Agent Definition Enhancement (dev.md, qa.md, etc.)
## Workspace Commands
- `*workspace-init` - Initialize collaborative workspace for this project
- `*workspace-status` - Show current workspace status and active collaborations
- `*workspace-cleanup` - Clean up workspace files and optimize storage
- `*workspace-handoff [agent]` - Prepare context handoff to specified agent
- `*workspace-sync` - Synchronize with latest workspace context
```

**Automatic Session Lifecycle:**
1. **Session Start:** Auto-register session, load workspace context, restore previous state
2. **Active Operations:** Continuous heartbeat, context persistence, collaboration tracking
3. **Agent Transitions:** Seamless handoffs with automatic context transfer
4. **Session End:** Context persistence, session cleanup, handoff preparation

**Context-Aware Features:**
- **Smart Suggestions:** Recommend workspace actions based on current development context
- **Auto-Handoffs:** Detect when work is ready for next agent and suggest handoff
- **Context Restoration:** Quickly resume previous work with full context
- **Collaboration Awareness:** Show active collaborators and their current focus

**Integration with BMAD Installer:**
```javascript
// Enhanced installer logic for Claude Code CLI
if (selectedIDEs.includes('claude-code')) {
  await this.setupClaudeCodeWorkspaceCommands();
  // Add native commands to agent definitions
  // Configure automatic session management
  // Set up enhanced UX features
}
```

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Native commands execute within 50ms for typical operations
- Background maintenance runs during session idle periods
- Context operations optimized for Claude Code CLI token efficiency
- Intelligent caching reduces workspace file I/O overhead

### Testing

**Testing Standards:**
- **Test Location:** `/tmp/tests/claude-code-optimization/`
- **Test Framework:** Claude Code CLI integration testing with mock sessions
- **Test Coverage:** Native commands, session lifecycle, handoffs, maintenance
- **Performance Testing:** Verify enhanced operations meet Claude Code CLI responsiveness standards

**Specific Test Requirements:**
- **Native Command Testing:** Verify all workspace commands work seamlessly in Claude Code CLI
- **Session Lifecycle Testing:** Test automatic registration, heartbeat, and cleanup
- **Handoff Testing:** Verify seamless agent transitions within Claude Code CLI sessions
- **Maintenance Testing:** Test automatic repair and optimization features
- **Integration Testing:** Ensure compatibility with existing Claude Code CLI workflows
- **Performance Testing:** Verify all operations maintain Claude Code CLI responsiveness
- **User Experience Testing:** Validate enhanced features improve actual development workflows

**Claude Code CLI Specific Testing:**
- Mock Claude Code CLI session lifecycle events
- Test workspace command integration with existing tool usage
- Validate automatic features don't interfere with normal Claude Code operations
- Test workspace features with realistic Claude Code development scenarios
