## Dev Notes

### Context Persistence Architecture

**Design Philosophy:**
- **Incremental capture:** Context builds gradually through agent operations
- **Structured storage:** Consistent markdown format for human readability and agent parsing
- **Intelligent compression:** Preserve critical decisions while summarizing routine progress
- **Session continuity:** New sessions can resume with full context understanding

**Context File Formats:**

**shared-context.md:**
```markdown
# Workspace Context
**Last Updated:** [timestamp]
**Active Sessions:** [session-ids]
**Primary Agent:** [current-agent]

## Current Focus
[Current development focus and active story]

## Key Decisions
- [Decision 1 with date and rationale]
- [Decision 2 with date and rationale]

## Next Steps
- [Priority action items]
- [Pending handoffs]

## Session Notes
[Agent-specific notes and observations]
```

**decisions-log.md:**
```markdown
# Architectural & Design Decisions

## Decision 001: [Decision Title]
**Date:** [timestamp]
**Agent:** [deciding-agent]
**Context:** [story or situation context]
**Decision:** [what was decided]
**Rationale:** [why this decision was made]
**Alternatives:** [other options considered]
**Impact:** [expected impact on project]
**Status:** [active/deprecated/superseded]
```

**Progress Integration Points:**
- Hooks into `*develop-story` for task completion tracking (Claude Code CLI)
- File-based progress tracking for other IDEs through workspace utilities
- Integration with `*reality-audit` for quality metrics persistence across all development environments
- Connection to agent handoff procedures for context transfer using IDE-agnostic file operations
- Compatibility with existing BMAD installer for automatic setup
- Graceful coexistence with TodoWrite tool and other existing progress tracking mechanisms
- Cross-IDE context sharing through standardized markdown file formats

**Performance Considerations:**
- Context files cached in memory during active sessions
- Lazy loading of archived context only when explicitly requested
- Asynchronous context persistence to avoid blocking agent operations
- Intelligent context compaction triggered by file size thresholds

### Testing

**Testing Standards:**
- **Test Location:** `/tmp/tests/context-persistence/`
- **Test Framework:** Node.js with built-in assert and fs modules
- **Mock Strategy:** Mock file system operations and agent command hooks
- **Performance Testing:** Verify context operations complete within 50ms

**Specific Test Requirements:**
- **Context Capture Testing:** Verify automatic context capture during agent operations across different IDEs
- **Retrieval Testing:** Test context loading and decision lookup functionality for both native commands and utility scripts
- **Compaction Testing:** Validate intelligent summarization preserves critical information
- **Integration Testing:** Test with actual BMAD agent commands and workflows across supported IDEs
- **Cross-IDE Testing:** Verify context persistence works with Claude Code CLI, Cursor, Windsurf, and other supported IDEs
- **Concurrency Testing:** Verify multiple sessions from different IDEs can read/write context safely
- **Recovery Testing:** Test context restoration from corrupted or incomplete files
- **Installer Testing:** Verify context persistence setup during BMAD installation process

**Test Data:**
- Sample context files with various decision types and complexity levels
- Mock agent command execution scenarios
- Test archives with different compression ratios and content types
