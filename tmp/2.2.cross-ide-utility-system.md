## Dev Notes

### Cross-IDE Utility Architecture

**Design Philosophy:**
- **Universal Access:** Full workspace functionality available to all IDE users
- **Consistent Experience:** Standardized operations regardless of IDE choice
- **File-Based Integration:** Leverage file system as universal integration layer
- **IDE Flexibility:** Support team members using different development environments

**Node.js Utility Scripts Structure:**
```
workspace-utils/
├── init.js              # Workspace initialization
├── status.js            # Status reporting and analytics
├── cleanup.js           # Maintenance and optimization
├── handoff.js           # Agent handoff management
├── sync.js              # Context synchronization
├── health.js            # Workspace health monitoring
├── templates/           # Workspace file templates
└── docs/               # IDE-specific documentation
    ├── cursor.md
    ├── windsurf.md
    ├── trae.md
    ├── roo.md
    ├── cline.md
    ├── gemini.md
    └── github-copilot.md
```

**Package.json Integration:**
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "workspace-init": "node workspace-utils/init.js",
    "workspace-status": "node workspace-utils/status.js",
    "workspace-cleanup": "node workspace-utils/cleanup.js",
    "workspace-handoff": "node workspace-utils/handoff.js",
    "workspace-sync": "node workspace-utils/sync.js",
    "workspace-health": "node workspace-utils/health.js"
  }
}
```

**IDE-Specific Configurations:**

**Cursor Integration:**
- Workspace commands available through terminal
- Custom rules in `.cursor/rules/workspace.mdc`
- Workspace status visible in Cursor sidebar

**Windsurf Integration:**
- Workspace utilities callable from Windsurf terminal
- Custom workspace panel integration
- File-based context sharing with Windsurf sessions

**Trae Integration:**
- Terminal-based workspace commands
- Integration with Trae's project management features
- Workspace status in Trae dashboard

**File-Based Integration Patterns:**
```markdown
# Workspace Integration Hook Example
# File: .workspace/hooks/context-update.json
{
  "trigger": "file-change",
  "target": ".workspace/context/shared-context.md",
  "action": "broadcast-update",
  "recipients": ["all-active-sessions"]
}
```

**Cross-IDE Session Coordination:**
- Sessions identified by IDE type and unique session ID
- Context sharing through standardized markdown files
- Handoffs work between different IDE environments
- Consistent workspace experience regardless of IDE choice

**BMAD Installer Integration:**
```javascript
// Enhanced installer for non-Claude Code IDEs
async setupWorkspaceScripts(ides) {
  await this.createWorkspaceUtilsDirectory();
  await this.generatePackageJsonScripts();
  
  for (const ide of ides) {
    if (ide !== 'claude-code') {
      await this.setupIDESpecificWorkspace(ide);
      await this.generateIDEDocumentation(ide);
    }
  }
}
```

### Testing

**Testing Standards:**
- **Test Location:** `/tmp/tests/cross-ide-utilities/`
- **Test Framework:** Node.js with cross-IDE simulation
- **Test Coverage:** Utility scripts, file-based integration, IDE-specific setups
- **Integration Testing:** Test with multiple IDE environments simultaneously

**Specific Test Requirements:**
- **Utility Script Testing:** Verify all Node.js utilities work correctly across operating systems
- **File-Based Integration Testing:** Test workspace operations through file system hooks
- **Cross-IDE Compatibility Testing:** Verify workspace features work with different IDE configurations
- **Session Coordination Testing:** Test handoffs and collaboration between different IDE environments
- **Documentation Testing:** Verify IDE-specific setup instructions are accurate and complete
- **Performance Testing:** Ensure utility scripts complete operations within acceptable timeframes
- **Error Handling Testing:** Test graceful degradation when specific IDE features are unavailable

**IDE Simulation Testing:**
- Mock different IDE environments for testing
- Simulate cross-IDE collaboration scenarios
