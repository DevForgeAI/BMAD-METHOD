# Story 1.1: Workspace Foundation

## Status
In Progress - 75% Complete

## Story

**As a** Claude Code CLI user working with BMAD-Method,  
**I want** a foundational workspace file system that enables shared context between sessions,  
**so that** I can collaborate with multiple AI agents without losing critical development context.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Workspace Directory Structure Creation**
   - [ ] Create `.workspace/` directory structure with all required subdirectories
   - [ ] Implement workspace initialization function that creates directory structure
   - [ ] Ensure proper file permissions and cross-platform compatibility

2. **Session Registry System**
   - [ ] Implement session tracking in `.workspace/sessions/` directory
   - [ ] Create session registration and deregistration mechanisms
   - [ ] Provide session heartbeat monitoring with timeout cleanup

3. **Basic File-Based Locking**
   - [ ] Implement file-based locking mechanism using `.lock` files
   - [ ] Create atomic write operations with temporary files and rename
   - [ ] Provide lock timeout and abandoned lock cleanup

4. **Workspace Management Interface**
   - [ ] Create `*workspace-init` command for Claude Code CLI workspace initialization
   - [ ] Create `*workspace-status` command showing active sessions and structure
   - [ ] Create `*workspace-cleanup` command for maintenance operations
   - [ ] Implement Node.js utility scripts for non-Claude Code IDEs (`npm run workspace-init`, etc.)
   - [ ] Provide IDE-agnostic workspace management through file-based operations

5. **Error Handling and Recovery**
   - [ ] Implement workspace corruption detection and repair
   - [ ] Provide graceful degradation when workspace unavailable
   - [ ] Create comprehensive error messages with remediation guidance

## Dev Notes

### Workspace Architecture Context
Based on the Collaborative Workspace System PRD, this foundational story establishes the core file-based infrastructure that enables multi-session collaboration without external dependencies.

**Core Design Principles:**
- **File-based coordination:** Leverage file system as the collaboration medium
- **Zero external dependencies:** No databases, services, or network requirements
- **Cross-platform compatibility:** Support Windows and Linux environments
- **Atomic operations:** Prevent data corruption through proper file handling
- **Graceful degradation:** System continues working even if workspace unavailable

**Directory Structure Layout:**
```
.workspace/
├── sessions/           # Active session tracking ([session-id].json files)
├── context/           # Shared context files (shared-context.md, decisions.md)
├── handoffs/          # Agent transition packages ([agent]-to-[agent]-[timestamp].md)
├── decisions/         # Design and architecture decisions (decisions-log.md)
├── progress/          # Story and task progress (progress-summary.md)
├── quality/           # Quality metrics and audits (quality-metrics.md)
└── archive/           # Compacted historical context (archived-[date].md)
```

**Integration Points:**
- Must integrate with existing BMAD-Method agent definitions across all supported IDEs (Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, Trae, Roo, Cline, Gemini, GitHub Copilot)
- Should extend current task execution framework with IDE-agnostic approach
- Needs to work optimally within Claude Code CLI session lifecycle while supporting other IDEs
- Must maintain backward compatibility with non-workspace sessions
- Integration with BMAD installer for automatic workspace setup during installation
- Cross-IDE compatibility through file-based operations and utility scripts

**Key Technical Requirements:**
- **File I/O Performance:** Operations complete within 100ms
- **Concurrency Support:** Handle up to 5 concurrent sessions
- **Memory Efficiency:** Limit workspace caching to 10MB per session
- **Error Recovery:** Automatic repair of common corruption issues

### Testing

**Testing Standards:**
- **Test Location:** `/tmp/tests/workspace-foundation/`
- **Test Framework:** Node.js with built-in assert module (no external test dependencies)
- **Test Coverage:** 
  - Directory creation and permission verification
  - Session registration and cleanup
  - File locking mechanism validation
  - Cross-platform compatibility testing (Windows/Linux)
  - Cross-IDE compatibility testing (Claude Code CLI vs utility scripts)
  - Error handling and recovery scenarios
- **Integration Testing:** Test with multiple simulated sessions across different IDE environments
- **Performance Testing:** Verify file operations complete within 100ms threshold
- **Installer Integration Testing:** Verify workspace setup during BMAD installation process

**Specific Test Requirements:**
- Mock file system operations for unit testing
- Test concurrent access scenarios with multiple sessions across different IDEs
- Validate workspace repair functionality with corrupted structures
- Cross-platform testing on both Windows and Linux environments
- IDE compatibility testing: Claude Code CLI native commands vs Node.js utility scripts
- Installer integration testing: verify workspace setup during `npx bmad-method install`
- Graceful degradation testing: ensure non-workspace users can still use BMAD normally
