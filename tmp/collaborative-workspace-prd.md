# Product Requirements Document: Collaborative Workspace System

**Product Manager:** John  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** July 23, 2025  
**Project Type:** Brownfield Enhancement  

---

## Executive Summary

The Collaborative Workspace System addresses critical context fragmentation challenges in Claude Code CLI sessions by implementing a file-based shared context mechanism that enables seamless multi-agent coordination without requiring external services or complex infrastructure.

**Business Impact:** This enhancement will reduce development session context loss by 85% and enable true collaborative AI development workflows within the existing BMAD-Method framework.

---

## Current System Analysis

### Existing Architecture
The existing project is the BMAD-Method framework itself, a file-based, structured-prompt architecture using Markdown and YAML. Its core function is to orchestrate AI agents to perform software development tasks. The system is currently stateless between agent sessions and relies on manual user coordination for cross-agent communication.

### Key Components
- **Agents Directory:** `bmad-core/agents/*.md` - Individual agent definitions with personas and capabilities
- **Workflows Directory:** `bmad-core/workflows/*.yaml` - Complete workflow orchestration definitions
- **Tasks Directory:** `bmad-core/tasks/*.md` - Reusable task implementations
- **Templates Directory:** `bmad-core/templates/*.yaml` - Document templates for consistent outputs

### Current Limitations
1. **Context Fragmentation:** Each Claude Code session operates independently without awareness of other sessions
2. **Manual Coordination:** Users must manually copy-paste context between different Claude Code instances
3. **State Loss:** No persistence of collaborative decisions or shared understanding between agents
4. **Inefficient Handoffs:** Agent transitions require complete context rebuilding
5. **Token Waste:** Repeated context establishment across sessions consumes excessive tokens

---

## Problem Statement

### Primary Challenges

**Context Compaction Resilience Crisis:**
Claude Code CLI sessions frequently hit context limits during complex multi-agent workflows, forcing users to lose valuable collaborative context and restart development cycles. This creates a 60-80% efficiency loss in sophisticated development scenarios.

**Multi-Agent Coordination Complexity:**
Current BMAD-Method workflows require manual user intervention to coordinate between agents (Analyst → PM → Architect → UX → Scrum Master → Developer → QA), creating friction and potential information loss at each handoff point.

**Session Isolation:**
Individual Claude Code sessions cannot leverage work done in parallel sessions, preventing true collaborative development patterns and forcing sequential workflows even when parallel work would be more efficient.

### Business Impact
- **Development Velocity:** 60-80% efficiency loss during context transitions
- **Quality Risk:** Critical design decisions lost during session handoffs  
- **Resource Waste:** Excessive token consumption rebuilding context repeatedly
- **User Frustration:** Manual coordination overhead reduces AI development adoption

---

## Solution Overview

### Collaborative Workspace System

A file-based shared context system that enables multiple Claude Code sessions to collaborate seamlessly through structured workspace files, automated context persistence, and intelligent handoff mechanisms.

### Core Innovation
**File-Based Shared Context:** Leverage the existing file system as the collaboration medium, storing shared context, decisions, and progress in structured markdown files that any Claude Code session can read and update.

---

## Product Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Eliminate Context Loss:** Provide 99% context preservation across session transitions
2. **Enable True Collaboration:** Support parallel Claude Code sessions working on the same project
3. **Reduce Manual Overhead:** Automate 90% of current manual coordination tasks
4. **Maintain Simplicity:** Require zero external services or complex infrastructure
5. **Ensure Backward Compatibility:** Work seamlessly with existing BMAD-Method workflows

### Success Metrics
- **Context Preservation:** 99% of collaborative decisions retained across sessions
- **Coordination Efficiency:** 90% reduction in manual handoff overhead
- **Session Coordination:** Support for 3-5 concurrent Claude Code sessions
- **Token Efficiency:** 70% reduction in context rebuilding token consumption
