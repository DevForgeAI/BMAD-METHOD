## Dev Notes

### Agent Handoff Architecture

**Handoff Package Structure:**
```markdown
# Agent Handoff: [Source] → [Target]
**Created:** [timestamp]
**Source Agent:** [source-agent-name]
**Target Agent:** [target-agent-name]
**Handoff ID:** [unique-handoff-id]

## Context Summary
[Complete context summary relevant to target agent]

## Key Decisions Made
[Decisions made by source agent that impact target agent's work]

## Current Progress
[Story progress, completed tasks, pending items]

## Next Actions for [Target Agent]
- [ ] [Priority action 1 with context]
- [ ] [Priority action 2 with context]
- [ ] [Priority action 3 with context]

## Files and References
[List of relevant files, documentation, and previous decisions]

## Blockers and Dependencies
[Any blockers or dependencies target agent should be aware of]

## Quality Metrics
[Relevant quality scores and compliance information]

## Handoff Validation
- [ ] Context completeness verified
- [ ] Decisions documented
- [ ] Next actions clearly defined
- [ ] References included
- [ ] Quality metrics current
```

**Agent-Specific Filtering:**
- **Developer Handoffs:** Include technical details, architecture decisions, code references, and implementation requirements (works across all IDEs)
- **QA Handoffs:** Include acceptance criteria, testing requirements, quality standards, and validation approaches (IDE-agnostic)
- **Architect Handoffs:** Include design decisions, technical constraints, integration requirements, and system architecture (cross-IDE compatibility)
- **PM Handoffs:** Include business requirements, stakeholder decisions, scope changes, and timeline considerations (universal format)
- **Cross-IDE Handoffs:** Include IDE-specific context and formatting preferences for optimal experience in receiving environment

**Integration Points:**
- **Story Development:** Handoffs trigger automatically when stories reach completion or agent transition points across all supported IDEs
- **Quality Audits:** QA results automatically generate handoffs back to developers for remediation regardless of IDE choice
- **Workflow Orchestration:** Integration with BMAD workflow definitions for automated agent sequencing with cross-IDE support
- **Context Persistence:** Handoffs update shared context and decision logs automatically using IDE-agnostic file operations
- **BMAD Installer Integration:** Handoff system setup during installation for seamless cross-IDE collaboration
- **IDE Flexibility:** Support handoffs between different IDE environments (e.g., architect using Cursor hands off to developer using Claude Code)

**Performance Requirements:**
- Handoff generation completes within 200ms for typical context volumes
- Supports up to 10 pending handoffs per workspace
- Handoff validation runs in under 100ms
- Asynchronous processing doesn't block source agent completion

### Testing

**Testing Standards:**
- **Test Location:** `/tmp/tests/agent-handoff/`
- **Test Framework:** Node.js with assert module and mock filesystem
- **Test Coverage:** Handoff generation, validation, filtering, and queue management
- **Integration Testing:** Test with actual BMAD agent workflows and realistic context volumes

**Specific Test Requirements:**
- **Handoff Generation Testing:** Verify complete context capture and agent-specific filtering
- **Validation Testing:** Test handoff completeness verification and gap detection
- **Queue Management Testing:** Test multiple concurrent handoffs and expiration handling
- **Agent Integration Testing:** Test handoffs between different BMAD agent types
- **Performance Testing:** Verify handoff operations meet timing requirements
- **Error Recovery Testing:** Test handoff corruption recovery and incomplete handoff handling

**Mock Scenarios:**
- Developer completing story in Claude Code CLI and handing off to QA using Cursor
- QA finding issues in Windsurf and handing back to Developer using Claude Code
- Architect finishing design in Cursor and handing off to Developer using Claude Code CLI
- Multiple agents with overlapping handoff timing across different IDE environments
- Cross-IDE team collaboration: PM using Gemini CLI, Developer using Claude Code, QA using Cursor
