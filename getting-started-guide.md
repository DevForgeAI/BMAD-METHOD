## 📋 Step-by-Step Workflows

### 🔄 Core Development Cycle

#### 1. **Start Your Story Development**
```bash
*develop-story
```
**What happens:**
- Systematic story implementation with dual-track progress
- Automatic story file checkbox updates `[x]` 
- Real-time File List maintenance
- TodoWrite tool integration for transparency

**Example Output:**
```
✅ Task 1: Create user authentication component [x]
✅ Task 2: Add login validation logic [x] 
⏳ Task 3: Implement session management [ ]

📁 Files Modified:
- src/components/AuthComponent.tsx (new)
- src/utils/validation.ts (modified)
- src/types/auth.ts (new)
```

#### 2. **Validate Your Work Quality**
```bash
*reality-audit
```
**What happens:**
- 10-phase comprehensive quality audit
- Automatic A-F grading with composite scoring
- Zero-touch remediation execution
- Automatic options presentation

**Example Output:**
```
🔍 Reality Audit Results: Grade B (Score: 82/100)

📊 Breakdown:
- Reality Score: 88/100 (35.2 points)
- Regression Prevention: 78/100 (27.3 points) 
- Technical Debt: 80/100 (20.0 points)

✅ Automatic Actions Taken:
- Generated remediation story for TypeScript strict mode
- Split oversized authentication story into 3 focused stories
- Updated architectural compliance documentation

📋 Your Options:
A. [5 min] Fix TypeScript issues and re-audit → Grade A eligible
B. [15 min] Refactor for better pattern compliance → Comprehensive improvement
C. [2 min] Proceed with current quality → Acceptable for development
```

#### 3. **Handle Issues Automatically**
When quality issues are detected:

**🤖 Automatic Remediation (Zero Commands Required):**
- Quality issues → Remediation stories generated automatically
- Oversized stories → Auto-split into manageable pieces
- Mixed concerns → Surgical fix stories created immediately

**Example:**
```
🤖 AUTO-REMEDIATION EXECUTED:

Issue Detected: Authentication story contains 12 tasks (>8 limit)
📋 Auto-Generated Stories:
1. "Auth-Core: Login/logout functionality" (4 tasks)
2. "Auth-Validation: Input validation and error handling" (3 tasks)  
3. "Auth-Session: Session management and persistence" (5 tasks)

✅ Original story updated with cross-references
✅ New stories added to backlog with proper context
✅ No manual commands required - ready to continue development
```

### 🆘 When You Get Stuck

#### Loop Detection & External Collaboration
After 3 failed attempts on the same issue:

```bash
*escalate
```

**What happens:**
- Automatic generation of collaboration prompts
- Copy-paste ready for external LLMs (Gemini, GPT-4, Claude)
- Context preservation for seamless handoffs

**Example Output:**
```
🔄 LOOP DETECTED: 3 failed attempts on TypeScript integration

🤝 COLLABORATION PROMPT GENERATED:
Copy this to Gemini/GPT-4/Claude for additional perspective:

COLLABORATION REQUEST: TypeScript Integration Challenge

CONTEXT: Working on authentication system integration with strict TypeScript requirements.

FAILED ATTEMPTS:
1. Generic type definitions - caused circular dependencies
2. Interface-based approach - broke existing validation logic  
3. Utility type solution - increased complexity without solving core issue

SPECIFIC CHALLENGE: Need to integrate new auth types with existing validation system without breaking current implementations or introducing circular dependencies.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Must maintain backward compatibility
- Cannot modify existing validation interfaces
- TypeScript strict mode required

QUESTION: What alternative TypeScript patterns could solve this integration challenge while maintaining clean architecture?

## 🚀 Advanced Techniques

### 🎯 Quality Score Optimization

#### Understanding Composite Scoring:
- **Reality Score (40%):** Actual vs simulated implementation
- **Regression Prevention (35%):** Consistency with existing patterns
- **Technical Debt (25%):** Long-term maintainability

#### Pro Tips for Grade A (90-100):
1. **Perfect Reality Score:** 
   - No mock implementations
   - Full functional code
   - Comprehensive integration testing

2. **Excellent Regression Prevention:**
   - Follow existing architectural patterns
   - Maintain API consistency
   - Comprehensive backward compatibility

3. **Minimal Technical Debt:**
   - Clear, self-documenting code
   - Proper error handling
   - Scalable design patterns

### 🔧 Workspace Collaboration Features

#### Cross-IDE Session Management
```bash
*workspace-init      # Initialize collaborative session
*workspace-status    # Check collaboration context
*workspace-handoff   # Context-aware agent transitions
*workspace-cleanup   # Automated maintenance
*workspace-sync      # Synchronize context
```

#### IDE-Optimized Commands
**Auto-detected environments:**
- Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, Trae, Roo, Cline, Gemini, GitHub Copilot

**What happens automatically:**
- Uses IDE-native tools instead of bash commands
- Eliminates approval prompts

### 📊 Token Efficiency Strategies

#### Smart Resource Management:
- **78-86% token reduction** through intelligent routing
- **Lightweight operations** for routine tasks (300-800 tokens vs 2,000-5,000)
- **Session-based caching** eliminates repeated analysis

#### Optimization Techniques:
1. **Use targeted commands:** `*reality-audit` vs generic analysis
2. **Leverage caching:** Repeated operations use cached results
3. **Context-aware execution:** Complexity matched to task requirements
4. **Pattern reuse:** Proven approaches over custom solutions
