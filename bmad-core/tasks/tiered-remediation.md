# Tiered Remediation System

Intelligent remediation that provides lightweight quick fixes for simple issues and comprehensive remediation stories for complex problems.

[[LLM: This tiered system uses 300-800 tokens for simple fixes vs 1500-2000+ tokens for full remediation stories]]

## Integration with Quality Framework

### **Environment-Adaptive Auto-Triage After Reality Audit**

```bash
# Auto-initialize environment detection if needed
if [ -z "$BMAD_PRIMARY_LANGUAGE" ]; then
  Read tool: bmad-core/tasks/auto-language-init.md
fi

if [ -z "$USE_IDE_TOOLS" ]; then
  Read tool: bmad-core/tasks/lightweight-ide-detection.md
fi

  # Classify remediation needs using environment-aware analysis

      ;;
  esac
}
```

### **Environment-Adaptive QA Agent Commands**

```bash
*quick-fix              # Tier 1 - immediate fixes (300-500 tokens) - Auto-adapts to current IDE
*guided-fix             # Tier 2 - guided approach (500-800 tokens) - Uses environment-appropriate tools  
*create-remediation     # Tier 3 - full story (1500-2000+ tokens) - Environment context included
*auto-triage           # Smart triage based on complexity (100-2000 tokens) - Universal IDE compatibility

# Environment context automatically included in all commands:
# - Uses Grep/Read/Glob tools in Claude Code CLI for pattern detection
# - Falls back to batched commands in traditional CLI environments
# - Preserves language-specific remediation patterns from auto-detection
# - Optimizes token usage based on IDE capabilities
```

## Token Usage Optimization

### **Tier Distribution Analysis**
Based on typical quality audit results:

| Tier | Percentage | Token Cost | Use Case |
|------|------------|------------|----------|
| **Tier 1** | 60% | 300-500 | Simple simulation patterns, minor violations |
| **Tier 2** | 25% | 500-800 | Interface mismatches, moderate architecture issues |
| **Tier 3** | 15% | 1,500-2,000 | Complex architectural problems, major refactoring |

### **Expected Token Savings**

**Previous Approach (Always Full Remediation):**
- 10 issues/day √ó 1,800 tokens = 18,000 tokens/day

**New Tiered Approach:**
- Tier 1: 6 √ó 400 = 2,400 tokens
- Tier 2: 2.5 √ó 650 = 1,625 tokens  
- Tier 3: 1.5 √ó 1,800 = 2,700 tokens
- **Total: 6,725 tokens/day**

**Savings: 63%** while maintaining quality and comprehensive coverage when needed

## Integration Points

### **Dev Agent Integration**
```yaml
quality_issue_workflow:
  - execute_reality_audit
  - auto_remediation_triage     # Smart tier assignment
  - apply_appropriate_fixes     # Tier-specific approach
  - validate_resolution         # Confirm issue resolved
```

### **QA Agent Integration**  
```yaml
remediation_workflow:
  - assess_issue_complexity     # Determine appropriate tier
  - provide_tiered_solution     # Apply tier-specific remediation
  - track_resolution_success    # Monitor effectiveness
```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Smart triage classification (100-200 tokens)
- [ ] Tier 1 quick fixes for 60% of issues (300-500 tokens each)
- [ ] Tier 2 guided fixes for 25% of issues (500-800 tokens each)
- [ ] Tier 3 full stories for 15% of complex issues (1500-2000+ tokens each)
- [ ] 60-70% overall token savings compared to always using full remediation
- [ ] Maintains quality standards across all tiers
- [ ] Integration with existing quality framework

This provides **intelligent remediation scaling** that matches solution complexity to issue complexity, maximizing efficiency while maintaining comprehensive coverage for complex problems!
