# Story 1.4b: Authentication Integration Testing

## Status
Ready

## Story
**As a** development team,  
**I want** to validate the authentication implementation with comprehensive integration testing,  
**so that** we have confidence the authentication system works end-to-end in all scenarios.

## Dependencies
- Story 1.4: Basic Authentication Setup (Complete)

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Keycloak realm and clients are automatically configured without manual intervention
2. Complete authentication flow works from Blazor UI through Keycloak to API
3. JWT tokens are properly validated by the API endpoints
4. Logout functionality clears sessions and redirects correctly
5. All authentication scenarios are tested and documented

## Dev Notes

### Issues Identified from Story 1.4
1. **Keycloak Realm Import Failures**
   ```
   ERROR: Unable to find composite realm role: uma_authorization
   Referenced client scope 'roles' doesn't exist
   Referenced client scope 'web-origins' doesn't exist
   ```

2. **Missing Configuration Files**
   - No `.env.example` file despite story mentioning environment variables
   - Manual setup steps not documented

3. **Package Version Conflicts**
   - Multiple Microsoft.IdentityModel package version warnings
   - Test project has version conflicts (6.35.0 vs 7.0.3)

4. **Untested Integration Points**
   - JWT token flow from Blazor to API never validated
   - Logout functionality not tested end-to-end
   - Error scenarios not covered

### Testing Environment Requirements
- Clean Docker environment for reliable testing
- Test user accounts in Keycloak
- Isolated test database
- Network connectivity for container-to-container communication

### Success Criteria
- All authentication flows work without manual intervention
- Automated tests validate critical scenarios
- Production deployment documentation complete
- No package version conflicts or build warnings
- Performance meets acceptable thresholds

## Acceptance Testing
To verify successful completion:
1. Fresh `docker-compose up` starts all services successfully
2. Keycloak realm and clients are automatically configured
3. Login flow works: Blazor → Keycloak → back to Blazor with user context
4. API calls include JWT tokens and validate successfully
5. Logout clears all sessions and returns to login
6. Automated tests pass in CI/CD pipeline
7. Production deployment checklist complete

## Security Considerations
- Validate all authentication flows for security best practices
- Ensure no sensitive information is logged
- Verify proper token expiration and refresh
- Confirm secure defaults for production deployment
- Test authentication bypass scenarios
